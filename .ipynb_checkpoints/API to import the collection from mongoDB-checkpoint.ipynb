       "  'date_published': '2 Jul 2020',\n",
       "  'text': ' </> A fire has reportedly damaged a building at a nuclear facility in Iran. </> Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) spokesman Behruz Kamalvandi said there was an incident in \"one of the industrial sheds under construction\" at the Natanz uranium enrichment plant.  </> There were no fatalities or concerns about contamination, he added. </> The AEOI later published a photo showing a partly burned building , which US-based analysts identified as a new centrifuge assembly workshop. </> Centrifuges are needed to produce enriched uranium, which can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons. </> Meanwhile, in a statement sent to BBC Persian journalists before the AEOI\\'s announcement, an unknown group calling itself \"Cheetahs of the Homeland\" claimed it had attacked the building. The group said its members were part of \"underground opposition with Iran\\'s security apparatus\". </> The claim could not immediately be verified by the BBC. </> The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors Iran\\'s compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal struck with world powers, said it was aware of the reports from Natanz and currently anticipated no impact on its verification activities. </> The incident comes six days after an explosion near the Parchin military complex. </> The Iranian authorities said the blast was caused by \"leaking gas tanks\" at the site, but  analysts said satellite photographs showed it happened at a nearby missile production facility .  </> Parchin is where Western powers suspect Iran carried out tests related to nuclear warhead detonations more than a decade ago. Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful and denies that it sought to develop nuclear weapons.  </> Natanz, which is about 250km (155 miles) south of the capital Tehran, is Iran\\'s largest uranium enrichment facility. </> Mr Kamalvandi told Iranian media that Thursday morning\\'s incident \"took place in one of the industrial sheds being built in the open-air part of the Natanz site\". </> \"There were no fatalities and no damage was done to the ongoing activities at the complex,\" he said. </> \"As the complex is not active, there is no concern about [radioactive] contamination. A team of experts of the AEOI are at the site investigating the reasons behind the incident,\" he added. </> The governor of Natanz city, Ramazanali Ferdowsi, was later quoted by Tasnim news agency as describing the incident as a fire. Fire fighters and rescue teams were deployed to the site, he added. </> The Natanz enrichment facility has three large underground halls capable of holding tens of thousands of centrifuges operating in cascades. Uranium hexafluoride gas is fed into them to separate out the most fissile isotope, U-235. </> The 2015 nuclear deal saw Iran agree only to produce low-enriched uranium, which has a 3-4% concentration of U-235 and can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. </> Iran also agreed to install no more than 5,060 of the oldest and least efficient centrifuges at Natanz until 2026, and not to carry out any enrichment at its other underground facility, Fordo, until 2031.  </> Last year, Iran began rolling back these commitments in retaliation for US President Donald Trump\\'s decision to abandon the nuclear accord and reinstate crippling economic sanctions lifted by his predecessor Barack Obama. </> In November, Iran said it had doubled the number of advanced centrifuges being operated at Natanz and  begun injecting uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges at Fordo .

       "  'text': ' </> The Trump administration has asked the US Supreme Court to invalidate Obamacare, which has provided health insurance to millions of Americans. </> Government lawyers said the act became invalid when the previous Republican-led Congress axed parts of it. </> Democratic challenger Joe Biden attacked the move, saying Mr Trump had put millions of lives at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. </> Health care will be a key battleground in the November presidential election. </> Some 20 million Americans could lose their health coverage if the court overturns the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was introduced by Donald Trump\\'s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.  </> The act\\'s popular provisions include banning insurers from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents\\' health plans until age 26. Millions of low-income Americans were able to obtain insurance due to the act. </> Mr Trump says the scheme costs too much and has promised a different plan to replace it, preserving some popular elements of the existing law but covering fewer people. </> Under the act, millions of people in the United States must purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty.  </> But in 2017, Congress removed a key plank of the policy, eliminating the federal fine for those who did not sign up, known as the \"individual mandate\". </> In its filing to the Supreme Court late on Thursday, the justice department argued \"the individual mandate is not severable from the rest of the act\".  </> As a result, it said, \"the mandate is now unconstitutional as a result of Congress\\'s elimination... of the penalty for non-compliance\". </> Mr Trump cannot rely on Congress to complete the dismantling of Obamacare because the Democrats took control of the lower house in 2019. </> Mr Biden, who wants to rally the public behind an expanded Affordable Care Act, said some coronavirus survivors could lose their comprehensive healthcare coverage if the act was overturned. </> \"They would live their lives caught in a vice between Donald Trump\\'s twin legacies: his failure to protect the American people from the coronavirus, and his heartless crusade to take healthcare protections away from American families,\" Mr Biden said. </> In a statement on Friday, White House spokesman Judd Deere said Obamacare was \"an unlawful failure\". </> \"It limits choice, forces Americans to purchase unaffordable plans, and restricts patients with high-risk preexisting conditions from accessing the doctors and hospitals they need.\" </> The US has been badly hit by the pandemic, recording 2.4m confirmed coronavirus infections and 122,370 deaths - more than any other country.  </> But the  true number of infections is likely to be 10 times higher than the reported figure , according to the latest estimate by health officials. </> The Supreme Court is unlikely to hear the case before voters go to the polls in November, US media report.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> A teenager has been killed and another critically wounded in a shooting in Seattle\\'s autonomous zone. </> One teenager, 16, was fatally shot and died after being taken to hospital. The other victim, 14, is in intensive care. </> The zone, initially known as Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (Chaz) and now called Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (Chop), was set up amid protests over the killing of George Floyd. </> As it is part of a protest against police brutality, it is self-policing. </> In a statement, Seattle hospital Harborview Medical Center said one of the boys was brought in by a private vehicle at 03:15 local time, while the other was driven in by the Fire Department\\'s medical team at 03:30 on Monday. </> \"The male shooting victim who arrived to Harborview... at 03:30 from the Chop area on Capitol Hill in Seattle has unfortunately died,\" the statement added. </> Although the site was initially occupied by hundreds of peaceful protesters, this is the fourth shooting within the boundaries of Chop in the last 10 days.  </> In the first shooting, which happened in the early hours of 20 June, a 19-year-old man called Horace Lorenzo Anderson was killed and a 33-year-old man was injured.  </> A second shooting the next day left a 17-year-old boy injured, and another person was wounded in a third shooting two days later. </> After the latest violence city officials have said they are considering dismantling Chop, and reopening a police station in the area that was abandoned by officers when the zone was first set up. </> Chief Carmen Best, from the Seattle Police Department, said they had found a white Jeep \"riddled with bullet holes\" near one of the concrete barriers to Chop. </> She also accused protesters and residents of \"not being cooperative with our requests for help\", and said the zone was now \"not safe for anybody\". </> Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, a Democrat who served as US attorney under former President Barack Obama, has also been facing calls to resign from people on both sides of the political divide over her handling of protests in the city and Chop.  </> Last week, she said she would work with protesters to bring an end to the protest zone. However, the barricades are still up. </> According to local media, the area is largely peaceful during the day, with people relaxing in the park while volunteers hand out free food. </> It spans a six-block radius of the city\\'s trendy arts scene that has been gentrified in recent years. </> Protesters have planted a community garden and painted a large \"Black Lives Matter\" mural on the street. </> But at night, the area is said to become tense as demonstrators march and openly armed watchmen patrol the streets. </> The protests in Seattle in Washington state began in response to last month\\'s death in police custody of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. </> The area around East Precinct in Seattle became a battleground between protesters and police at the beginning of this month, leading the governor to send in the National Guard and the mayor to impose a curfew. </> The mayor finally ordered barricades to be removed near the precinct and the police building was boarded up. </> President Donald Trump, a Republican, had threatened to \"take back\" the city, but Mayor Durkan and Washington Governor Jay Inslee, both Democrats, told him to mind his own business.'},\n",

The series editor\\'s decision to reject the final paper was made on Tuesday 16 June and was officially communicated to the authors on Monday 22 June,\" the company said in a statement. </> Harrisburg University, meanwhile, took down its own press release \"at the request of the faculty involved\".  </> The paper was being updated \"to address concerns\", it said .  </> And while it supported academic freedom, research from its staff \"does not necessarily reflect the views and goals of this university\". </> The Coalition for Critical Technology organisers, meanwhile, have demanded \"all publishers must refrain from publishing similar studies in the future\".'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> Last weekend\\'s deadly knife attack in Reading, west of London, has been an uncomfortable reminder that the threat of terrorism has not gone away. But what about the so-called War on Terror, as declared by US President George W Bush in 2001? Is it still going on? And if not, has it been a triumph or a massive waste of money?  </> Nearly 19 years on from the day America was attacked on 11 September 2001 thousands of US servicemen and women remain stationed in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Gulf and the Horn of Africa. Drone strikes in remote regions of the world continue to target suspected terrorist leaders; counter-terrorism budgets across the world have ballooned to astronomical proportions to meet a myriad of ongoing threats.  </> Sasha Havliclek, the CEO of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, has been following this war since its inception. She maintains there is a distinction between the rhetoric and the reality: </> \"The rhetoric was done away with the minute President [Barack] Obama came into office [in 2009] but in reality there was much more continuity than rupture in the tactics of the war on terror. Under the Obama administration it\\'s well known that they massively scaled up droning attacks, for instance, in Afghanistan and Pakistan. And for all the talk of America First now.. and I think there is a wide perception that this is winding down...  we\\'ve actually seen a continued expansion of US counter-terrorism operations.\"  </> That\\'s a view largely endorsed by the man appointed by President Donald Trump as the US State Department\\'s co-ordinator for counter-terrorism, Ambassador Nathan Sales. I asked him whether this war - as originally conceived by the Bush administration - is over? </> \"No, the fight is very much ongoing, we\\'re winning the fight but we\\'re continuing to fight against a determined enemy or I should say a determined group of enemies.\" </> He points to the example of Islamic State (IS) where a vast, multi-national coalition successfully eliminated the last of the jihadists\\' physical caliphate at Baghuz in Syria last year, as well as its leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. Yet IS affiliates and networks, he concedes, are still very active around the world. </> On Wednesday, the State Department releases its annual Country Terrorism Reports.  </> To some in Washington, it must have all seemed so clear-cut in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the US.  </> Announcing the start of the \"War on Terror\" back then, President Bush declared that you were \"either with us or against us\". There was no middle ground, no allowance made for the subtle nuances of the Middle East with its ever-shifting alliances and allegiances. In Iraq, which the US and Britain invaded in 2003, this uncompromising position turned potential allies into enemies, laying the foundations for today\\'s ongoing global jihadist movement. Mina Al-Orabi is the Editor of the UAE newspaper The National. She is originally from Mosul, Iraq\\'s second city, which was devastated during the battle to dislodge IS from its streets. </> \"\\'In Iraq,\" she says, \"there were clear instances where the United States undercut the Iraqi state. Of course in 2003 the decision to dismantle the police and the military, the decision to put tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of young men out of work… with the idea that they should be completely excluded from the country, that became the nucleus for al-Qaeda in Iraq and then the nucleus of IS.\" </> Other policy mistakes have also been made as a part of this war that, although later reversed by President Obama, continue to have consequences today.  </> The detention of hundreds of suspects without trial in Guantanamo Bay, the practice of \"extraordinary rendition\" - blindfolding terror suspects and flying them across the world to CIA \"black sites\" where they were subjected to prolonged and \"enhanced interrogation\".  </> These have all been used by critics of the West to undermine its moral authority. Ambassador Sales from the US state department says that \"the world has learned a lot of lessons about what works and what doesn\\'t and we\\'ve incorporated those lessons into our current approaches\".  </> He is particularly irked by those critics of Guantanamo Bay, including Washington\\'s Western partners, who have now abandoned their citizens in desolate camps strung out across Syria and Iraq. He says these countries should take them back. </> It is impossible to pin down exactly how much the \"War on Terror\" has cost but most estimates put it well in excess of US $1 trillion. The vast bulk of that has been spent on \"kinetic\" military action, as well as intelligence-gathering and drone strikes. Only a tiny fraction has gone towards prevention - steering people away from the path of extremism. Shiraz Maher from Kings College London\\'s International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation believes this war has helped spawn many of today\\'s other problems in society. </> \"If you look at things like the wider Islamic State and Syria and Iraq or these types of thing,\" he says, \"then that fuelled a degree of xenophobia in Europe, that fuelled a degree of suspicion and hostility towards Muslims, which translated into animosity towards refugees and the refugee crisis that was a result of Syria. So you can see a cascading series of consequences. So I think it\\'s fair to say that the \\'War on Terror\\' is far from over in many senses.\" </> So will there ever be an end to this amorphous campaign? Will there be a decisive \"Mission Accomplished\" moment that brings the so-called War on Terror to a close? It is unlikely. Because, like crime, terrorism can only be reduced to what officials call \"manageable levels\". And today there is already a newly emerging threat, that of far-right extremism, something that will likely breathe new life into what appears to be a War without End.'},\n",

And once again the biggest stumbling block for the White House isn\\'t that their officials lacked the power to do what they want, it\\'s that they went about it the wrong way. </> The Justice Department\\'s attempt to rescind Daca, the Obama-era programme that provides normalised immigration status to some undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children, was \"arbitrary and capricious\", the court held, in a way prohibited by federal law.  </> That mirror\\'s the court\\'s conclusion in a decision last year blocking the Trump administration\\'s efforts to include a citizenship question on the decennial US census. </> Both opinions were written by Chief Justice John Roberts, whose technicality-minded devotion to a 1946 federal law unglamorously called the Administrative Procedures Act, is presenting an imposing obstacle to the administration\\'s policy objectives. </> \"We do not decide whether Daca or its rescission are sound policies,\" Roberts wrote, noting that the administration simply did not provide proper legal justifications or make appropriate considerations when it tried to act. </> Lower courts have cited the procedures act to throw up similar roadblocks to other Trump administration moves, particularly in the realm of environmental policy. The president\\'s political opponents have found that an executive branch not always meticulous about the details has presented plentiful legal lines of attack. </> While the Trump administration waged a lengthy court battle to have its Daca order upheld, there may be a few sighs of relief from the president\\'s campaign over this ruling.  </> A Trump win would have pushed hundreds of thousands of Daca recipients into the economic shadows or onto deportation rolls just months before the election. It would have put a sympathetic human face on the targets of administration\\'s hard-line immigration policies. </> Instead, this becomes another somewhat theoretical campaign issue. </> A re-elected Trump could make another run at Daca in his second term, putting the programme once again at risk. With four years under their belt, Trump officials may have learned a bit more about how to navigate the treacherous waters of administrative procedure. </> The president says the ultimate goal is to eventually provide Daca-like protections, but only as part of reform that accomplishes his larger objectives of limiting undocumented migration and restructuring the US immigration system. </> Meanwhile a President Joe Biden would have four years to further establish the programme - and push for Congress to come up with the permanent legislative solution that eluded his former boss, Barack Obama. </> In the meantime, the Supreme Court has given Daca recipients a reprieve, albeit on a technicality, leaving their ultimate fate still far from certain.'},\n",

She was the only black pupil there and faced angry crowds outside William Frantz Elementary School near her home. </> Only one teacher was willing to accept the young girl and she spent the year as a lone student.  </> Her experience inspired a famous painting by American artist Norman Rockwell, which was hung for a while at the White House by then-President Barack Obama.  </> \"The girl in that painting at six years old knew absolutely nothing about racism -  I was going to school that day,\" she said in 2011.  </> \"But the lesson that I took away that year, in an empty school building, was that none of us know anything about disliking one another when we come into the world.

       "  'text': ' </> Jean Kennedy Smith, a US envoy who played a key role in Northern Ireland peace process, has died aged 92. </> Her daughter Kym confirmed her death to US media on Thursday. </> Ms Smith was the second youngest of the nine Kennedy siblings, who included President John F Kennedy and Senator Robert F Kennedy. </> A diplomat, activist and humanitarian, Ms Smith was the last-surviving child of Joseph P Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald.  </> Ms Smith served as the US ambassador to Ireland in the 1990s, playing an important role in attempts to end sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. </> On Thursday, Mick Mulvaney, US special envoy to Northern Ireland, said:  \"Ambassador Smith played a critical role in advancing peace in Northern Ireland, leveraging deep personal empathy and courage.  </> \"We join with colleagues and friends to offer condolences to her family on her passing.\" </> In 2011, US President Barack Obama awarded Ms Smith the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the country. </> She led a quiet life until she entered politics, doing philanthropy work and keeping out of the limelight her prestigious family name attracted. </> Her first taste of politics came in 1960, when she campaigned across the country in support of her brother, John F Kennedy, who was running for the presidency.  </> By Mark Devenport, BBC Northern Ireland political editor </> Jean Kennedy Smith was appointed as the US Ambassador to Dublin in 1993 - a particularly sensitive time in Northern Ireland with the IRA considering  whether to call an end to its violent campaign of more than two decades.  </> The new ambassador brought the celebrity of her famous Irish American family to the role. She soon became convinced that granting a short term US visa for the Sinn  Féin leader Gerry Adams - against the wishes of the UK government - could play an important role in demonstrating to Irish republicans that adopting a peaceful political strategy would pay dividends.  </> Ambassador Kennedy Smith did not have to convince President Bill Clinton of the reasons for granting a visa - he had already promised much the same when campaigning for the White House. But she did clash with other US officials, including two diplomats at her own embassy who voiced their opposition.  The dispute became so bitter it earned her an official reprimand from the US Secretary of State Warren Christopher.  </> In the event Gerry Adams made a highly publicised 48-hour visit to New York in February 1994 - a move which paved the way for the IRA to call a ceasefire six months later. </> When Bill Clinton appointed Jean Kennedy Smith as ambassador he called her \"as Irish as an American can be\". When she finished her term as US ambassador in 1998, she received Irish citizenship for \"distinguished service to the nation\".  </> Ms Smith\\'s role in bringing the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to the negotiating table was seen as an important step in ending decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. </> \"The Irish people were willing to take me at face value, to give me the benefit of the doubt because I was a Kennedy,\" Ms Smith said of her time in office in 1998. \"I was a cog, really, in the machine that was moving. I was fortunate to be here to perhaps add momentum to what was happening.\" </> Born on 20 February, 1928 in Boston, Massachusetts, Ms Smith studied English at Manhattanville College.  </> In 1945, she was asked to launch the USS Joseph P Kennedy Jr, a newly commissioned Navy destroyer named for her brother, who died during World War Two. </> She published a memoir in 2016 called The Nine of Us in which she remarked that her childhood seemed \"unexceptional\". </> \"It is hard for me to fully comprehend that I was growing up with brothers who eventually occupy the highest offices of our nation, including president of the United States,\" she explained. </> In 1956, Jean Kennedy married Stephen E Smith, an executive in a transportation company founded by his grandfather. </> Mr Smith, a New York financier who advised the Kennedy family and oversaw their fortune, died in 1990. </> The couple are survived by their two daughters, Kym and Amanda, two sons, Stephen Jr and William, and six grandchildren.'},\n",

This Juneteenth we have an opportunity to unite against injustice and create lasting change,\" he continued. </> Texas was the first US state to declare Juneteenth a holiday in 1980. Now all but four US states observe or recognise the date in some form. </> This year, the date has become particularly prominent in the public consciousness amid a wave of protests over racial inequality following the deaths of several unarmed African Americans. Juneteenth rallies are planned in Washington DC and across the country. </> On 19 June, 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas received the news that slavery had been abolished by President Abraham Lincoln two years earlier.  </> The news took so long to reach slaves in Texas in part due to fighting that continued even after the surrender of the Confederacy that ended the Civil War, according to historians. </> The US National Archives said on Thursday that the original handwritten decree is believed to have been recently discovered, after a researcher was tasked with unearthing it due to heightened interested in the holiday. </> \"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, \\'all slaves are free,\\' \" the military order reads. </> \"This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labour.\"  </> The elaborately written note was found in a book of formal orders in Washington DC. </> \"I think it\\'s terrific. I think the timing is just amazing,\" David Ferriero, the head librarian of the Archives, told the Washington Post. </> Corporate America is also treating the holiday with more reverence than in previous years, with employees from Nike, Uber, and Twitter being given a paid day off. </> Google has asked employees to cancel non-urgent meetings and instead \"create space for learning and reflection\". </> Amazon told employees to \"take some time to reflect, learn and support each other\". </> In Washington, the most senior Republican in the Senate said on Thursday that he would introduce a bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. </> Four Democrats have also announced a similar proposal. </> In the House of Representatives, the Texas congresswoman who has been pushing for a national holiday for two decades, told CBS that the chances of a holiday becoming a reality are growing. </> \"The potential of having this national holiday opens a whole world of discussion for America, a whole reckoning with racism and the systemic racism that permeates the nation,\" said Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, adding that the House proposal now has the endorsement of 204 lawmakers. </> \"It\\'s delayed freedom, but it is the only recognition of the original sin of this nation,\" she continued. </> Former President Barack Obama, the first and only ever black US president, said in a statement that the holiday \"has never been a celebration of victory\", but is instead a \"celebration of progress\". </> \"It\\'s an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of our history, change is possible - and there is still so much work to do.\"  </> His wife, Michelle Obama - whose ancestors were slaves - said that for her, the delayed communication that freed Texas\\' slaves and the slow pace of equality for black Americans, show that \"even in that extended wait, we still find something to celebrate\".'},\n",

That makes me know we\\'re on the brink of real change.\" </> Rev Sharpton, who met Floyd\\'s family on Wednesday, said he would announce the launch of a new social movement at the memorial, as well as call for new federal legislation to end racial discrimination by police. </> Further tributes will be held at Floyd\\'s birthplace in North Carolina on Saturday, and in his home town of Houston on Monday. </> Mr Obama said it was vital to channel the momentum built up in the recent protests to bring about change. </> In his first video comments since Floyd\\'s death, he said the demonstrations were as profound as anything he had seen in his lifetime, and called on Americans to seize the chance to deal with the underlying problems in society. </> \"Too often some of that violence has come from folks who were supposed to be serving and protecting you,\" Mr Obama said. </> \"I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter, your dreams matter. </> \"There is a change in mindset that\\'s taking place, a greater recognition that we can do better,\" he added. </> Mr Obama did not comment directly on Mr Trump\\'s handling of the unrest, although he urged mayors around the country to review their use-of-force policies. </> The Duchess of Sussex has also issued a personal message  about Floyd\\'s death, saying his life mattered and recent events had been devastating. </> George Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. </> A video showed Floyd being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. </> Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands and  in the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. </> Floyd\\'s death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. </> For many, the outrage over Floyd\\'s death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination.  </> Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews.  </> They have been largely peaceful, with cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago relaxing their restrictions amid hopes that the worst of the violence had passed. </> A post-mortem examination has revealed that Floyd had the coronavirus in early April. But officials stressed that this played no role in his death.'},\n",

The Supreme Court\\'s bench is widely regarded as the most conservative in modern history.  </> Yet last year Chief Justice Roberts again joined his liberal-leaning counterparts in preventing the Trump administration from adding a question on citizenship to the 2020 census, which opponents had argued would suppress responses from immigrants and racial minorities.  </> The court has, however, sided with the Trump administration in two other major cases. </> It defended the White House\\'s travel ban affecting mostly Muslim countries, and allowed Mr Trump\\'s ban on transgender people in the military to go into effect. </> Once again the Supreme Court has ruled that a controversial action by the Trump administration is illegal. And once again the biggest stumbling block for the White House isn\\'t that their officials lacked the power, it\\'s that they went about exercising them in the wrong way. </> The Justice Department\\'s attempt to rescind Daca was \"arbitrary and capricious\", the court held, in a way prohibited by federal law. That mirrors the court\\'s conclusion in a decision last year blocking the Trump administration\\'s efforts to include a citizenship question on the decennial US census. </> Both opinions were written by Chief Justice John Roberts, whose technicality-minded devotion to a federal law is presenting an imposing obstacle to the administration\\'s policy objectives. </> While the Trump team waged a lengthy court battle to have its Daca order upheld, there may be a few sighs of relief from the president\\'s campaign over this ruling. A Trump win would have pushed hundreds of thousands of Daca recipients into the economic shadows or onto deportation rolls just months before the November election. It would have put a sympathetic human face on the targets of administration\\'s hard-line immigration policies. </> Instead, the Supreme Court has given Daca recipients a reprieve, leaving their ultimate fate still far from certain. </> Read Anthony\\'s full analysis here </> Most of the children protected by the Daca programme are from Mexico and other Latin American countries. </> A 2012 executive order, created by former President Obama, shields these so-called \"Dreamers\" from deportation, and provides work and study permits. </> Mr Obama signed the order following failed negotiations for immigration reform on Capitol Hill. </> In order to qualify for Daca, applicants under the age of 30 are required to submit personal information to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including addresses and phone numbers. </> They must go through an FBI background check and have a clean criminal background, and either be in school, recently graduated or have been honourably discharged from the military. </> In exchange, the US government agrees to \"defer\" any action on their immigration status for a period of two years. </> It is only available to individuals residing in the US since 2007. </> Daca recipients told the BBC they were relieved and surprised by the ruling on Thursday, and many said they would continue advocating for immigration reform. </> Juana Guzman of Texas, 28, said: \"It\\'s a very needed win and this is giving us the fuel we needed to continue moving forward and to keep fighting for the rest of our families and the community that does not have Daca\". </> Metzli Sanchez, 23, said: \"As big of a victory that this is, we have to keep applying pressure that we have to keep fighting for other people who are just as able and capable but who do not have this protection.\"'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> The death of George Floyd has prompted one of the biggest movements against racism since the civil rights era. </> Protests were held globally after video footage from Minneapolis showed a white police officer kneeling on Mr Floyd\\'s neck for almost nine minutes.  </> The 46-year-old could be heard repeatedly telling the officer, \"I can\\'t breathe\". </> Around the world, music became a crucial way for people to express their grief and anger.  </> Bob Marley\\'s Get Up, Stand Up  and  Bill Withers\\' Lean On Me  soundtracked several protests, while streaming figures for songs that call out police violence soared: from Childish Gambino\\'s This Is America and Kendrick Lamar\\'s Alright to NWA\\'s visceral hip-hop track [Expletive] Tha Police. </> The latter was also used by hackers to  disrupt police scanners in Chicago  during the protests.  </> In a more unifying moment, protestors in Atlanta encouraged the National Guard to join them in performing the Macarena. </> As the Black Lives Matter movement continues, the record industry has been  paused to examine its own history of racial exclusion , and the inequity between black artists and the mainly white executives who profit from their work. </> Meanwhile, artists have channelled their frustration and anger into a new wave of protest songs, directly inspired by Mr Floyd\\'s death and its aftermath. </> Here are some of the most striking examples - but please be aware that many of these songs contain explicit language. </> Sung from the perspective of a mourning mother whose son has been shot to death, Alicia Keys\\' new single was released on Juneteenth - a holiday celebrating the emancipation of enslaved people in the US. </> It was originally written in response to the deaths of Mike Brown and Sandra Bland, the former  killed by police in Missouri  in 2014, the latter who  died in a jail cell in 2015  after Texas police stopped her for a minor traffic violation - but Keys said the message was \"never not going to be relevant\". </> \"Of course there is no perfect way to die,\" she wrote in an Instagram caption, as she premiered the song. \"This phrase doesn\\'t even make sense but that\\'s what makes the title so powerful and heartbreaking because so many have died unjustly.  </> \"We all know none of these innocent lives should have been taken due to the culture of police violence.\" </> \"Just by the title, you know that it means something painful,\" said Grammy-nominated R&B artist H.E.R. as she  debuted her new song  in a living room concert. </> \"These lyrics were kind of easy to write because it came from a conversation of what\\'s happening right now, what\\'s been happening, and the change that we need to see,\" she said before her performance.  </> \"I think music is powerful when it comes to change and when it comes to healing, and that\\'s why I wrote this song, to make a mark in history.\" </> The sombre, guitar-led song asks: \" What is a gun to a man that surrenders / What\\'s it gonna take for someone to defend her / If we all agree that we\\'re equal as people / Then why can\\'t we see what\\'s evil? \" </> H.E.R. said the track tackles the question that\\'s been plaguing her over the last few weeks: Why is there so much hate? </> \"My favourite line in the song is,  \\'How do we cope when we don\\'t love each other?\\'\"  she told TMZ. \"I think we\\'re all questioning that now.\" </> From the very first bar, you can tell LL Cool J won\\'t be holding back. </> \" For 400 years you had your knees on our necks ,\" he raps. \" A garden of evil with no seeds of respect \". </> The 52-year-old goes on to ask what would have happened to former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, had he not been filmed by bystanders during Mr Floyd\\'s fatal arrest. </> \" Watching that man die slow left a hole, \" he says, \" If it wasn\\'t for them phones, Chauvin would be at home / Feeling justified because of George skin tone / I\\'m telling those with melanin, you\\'re not alone .\" </> Minneapolis artist Dua Saleh originally wrote Body Cast in response to the deaths of  Jamar Clark  and  Philando Castile , who were fatally shot by police in separate incidents in 2015 and 2016. </> \"Unfortunately, I could have written the song at any point in my life and it would have been relevant, which is frightening to say the least,\"  they told the Switched On Pop podcast. </> The intro samples clips of Angela Whitehead, a woman from Montana who went viral last year when she rebuked two police officers for entering her home without a warrant or viable cause. </> Saleh later references the stand-off in her lyrics, singing: \" You must be crazy, coming up in here talking about you heard something /  You heard me talking, I talk loud and I\\'m aggressive and guess what? / You did not knock on my door .\" </> \"I just don\\'t trust police officers in general,\" the singer said. \"I was just like disgusted at the thought that policing was a safe and viable option for black communities.\" </> Proceeds from the song\\'s download are being donated to the Minneapolis-based organisation, Black Visions Collective. </> \"Someone asked, how do I feel?\" Terrace Martin wrote, as he introduced his response to George Floyd\\'s death.  </> \"I told them hurt, fearless, angry, aware and fully ready to protect me, my family and my people at all cost. I got together with black men that felt the same way and created a work of truth.\" </> The result is Pig Feet - a frenetic and urgent collision of jazz and hip-hop, where Kamasi Washington\\'s fidgety saxophone emphasises lyrics about structural racism and police brutality. </> It was first released on YouTube, accompanied by a video compiling clips from recent Black Lives Matter protests, followed by a list of victims of police violence that scroll silently up the screen. </> Twelve-year-old Keedron Bryant gave voice to the feelings of thousands when he uploaded a simple, a capella performance of the original song I Just Wanna Live to Instagram three weeks ago. </> \"I\\'m a young black man / Doing all that I can / To stand, oh but when I look around / And I see what\\'s being done to my kind/ Every day, I\\'m being hunted as prey, \" he sang, looking directly into the camera. </> His performance, and the directness of the lyrics, written by his mother, won praise from Barack Obama, LeBron James, Janet Jackson and Katy Perry, who reposted the song to her followers with the message #BLACKLIVESMATTER. </> On Friday, record label  Warner Bros announced  it had signed Keedron to a recording contract. </> Follow us on  Facebook , or on Twitter  @BBCNewsEnts .

       "  'text': ' </> Ex-US Defence Secretary James Mattis has denounced President Donald Trump, saying he deliberately stokes division. </> He said he was \"angry and appalled\" by Mr Trump\\'s handling of ongoing protests over the death of African American George Floyd at the hands of police. </> Mr Mattis berated Mr Trump\\'s \"abuse of authority\" - and backed protesters seeking to uphold American values, as did ex-President Barack Obama.  </> Mr Trump has described Mr Mattis repeatedly as an \"overrated general\". </> Mr Mattis quit in 2018 after Mr Trump decided to pull US troops out of Syria. </> He has remained mostly silent since then, until  his rebuke of the Trump administration was published in The Atlantic magazine  on Wednesday. </> In response to the fresh criticism, Mr Trump posted a series of tweets in which he claimed to have fired Mr Mattis. </> \"I didn\\'t like his \"leadership\" style or much else about him, and many others agree,\" he wrote. \"Glad he is gone!\" </> The row comes as  new charges were brought against all of the sacked police officers present at Mr Floyd\\'s death  in the city of Minneapolis. </> The charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated to second-degree murder while the other three officers, previously uncharged, face counts of aiding and abetting murder. </> The death has sparked huge protests across the US in recent days. </> The vast majority of demonstrations over the past nine days have been peaceful, but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. </> \"Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try,\" Mr Mattis wrote in The Atlantic. \"Instead, he tries to divide us.\" </> He continued: \"We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\" </> Mr Mattis also addressed the recent wave of anti-racism protests. </> \"We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers,\" Mr Mattis wrote. \"The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values... as a nation.\" </> The retired general -  whose resignation letter in December 2018  was full of implied criticism of the president\\'s foreign policy - also condemned the use of the military in response to the protests. </> \"Never did I dream that troops... would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens,\" he said. </> \"Militarising our response, as we witnessed in Washington DC, sets up a conflict... between the military and civilian society,\" he added. </> Mr Mattis was referring to an incident earlier this week when peaceful protesters were dispersed with tear gas and rubber bullets from a park close to the White House.  </> Mr Trump then crossed the park for a photo-op at a historic church that had been damaged by fire in the unrest. </> This provoked sharp criticism from top Democrats and religious leaders , who accused the president of aggressively targeting the demonstrators for the purpose of posing for photographs. </> In his latest comments, Mr Mattis derided the \"bizarre photo-op\" and said clearing the park of demonstrators beforehand was an \"abuse of executive authority\". </> Mr Trump has repeatedly questioned whether the protesters were peaceful and, in an earlier tweet, he said \"people liked my walk to this historic place of worship\". </> And in an interview with his former press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday, the president once again defended the church visit. He said it was \"handled really well\" and \"religious leaders loved it\". </> Former President Barack Obama said it was vital to channel the momentum built up in the recent protests to bring about change. </> In his first video comments since Mr Floyd\\'s death, he said the demonstrations were as profound as anything he\\'d seen in his lifetime, and called on Americans to seize the chance to deal with the underlying problems in society. </> \"Too often some of that violence has come from folks who were supposed to be serving and protecting you,\" Mr Obama said. </> \"I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter, your dreams matter.\" </> \"There is a change in mindset that\\'s taking place, a greater recognition that we can do better,\" he added. </> Mr Obama did not comment directly on Mr Trump\\'s handling of the unrest, although he urged mayors around the country to review their use-of-force policies. </> Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has also issued a personal message  about Mr Floyd\\'s death, saying his life mattered and recent events had been devastating. </> Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews.  </> They have been largely peaceful, with cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago relaxing their restrictions amid hopes that the worst of the violence had passed. </> A post-mortem examination has revealed that Floyd had the coronavirus in early April. But officials stressed that this played no role in his death.'},\n",

If you start saying it is an elaborate hoax, where do we start?\" </> Mr Trump has said he thinks climate change is not happening. </> A moment later, Mr Obama told the audience: \"It used to be if you caught them [politicians] lying, they said: \\'Oh man\\'. Now they just keep on lying.\" </> Barack Obama said striving towards equality ensures a society can draw on the talents and the energy of all of its people. </> \"Just look at the French football team,\" he said to wild cheers, referring to France\\'s World Cup win days before. </> \"Not all of those folks looked like Gauls to me, but they are French - they are French.\" </> It is a \"plain fact\" that racial discrimination still exists in the US and South Africa, Mr Obama said. </> Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher </> Barack Obama offered what some of his supporters will see as not-so-veiled references to his successor in his speech honouring Nelson Mandela\\'s legacy, defending democratic institutions and a free press, and condemning \"strongman politics\" and shameless leaders who \"double down\" when caught lying.  </> The former president also offered a commodity he always seems to have in ready supply - hope. </> \"Things may go backwards for a while, but ultimately, right makes might,\" Mr Obama said. \"Not the other way around.\" </> It\\'s a riff on the Theodore Parker line he frequently quotes, about the arc of history being long but bending toward justice. </> If Mr Obama had a message for the world - and particularly for Americans unsure about the course their nation is on - it\\'s that the struggle is real, but the ending is a happy one. </> There are probably more than a few on the left, however, who wish Mr Obama would give more than a few speeches and carefully worded statements.  </> With mid-term elections that will determine control of Congress just four months away, they want him to step away from the podium and fully join the fight. </> You may also like: </> Barack Obama said the world\\'s elite were out of touch with the lives of the poor. </> \"In their business dealings, many titans of industry... are increasingly detached from any nation state\" and they \"live lives more and more isolated from ordinary people\", he said. </> As a result, their decisions to \"shut down a factory\" were seen as simply a \"rational response\" to shareholders\\' demands. </> Politicians using \"politics of fear, resentment, retrenchment\" were rising \"at a pace unimaginable just a few years ago,\" Barack Obama warned. </> Democracy is messy, he said, \"but the efficiency of an autocrat is a false promise\".  </> \"It is time for us to stop paying all of our attention to the world\\'s capitals... and focus on the world\\'s grassroots. That is where democracy comes from,\" he added. </> Warning against creeping populism and \"strongman politics\", he made the case for liberal democracy, saying that he believed it offered the better future for humanity. </> \"I believe in Nelson Mandela\\'s vision\" for the world\\'s future, he said, \"I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible\".  </> \"It can achieve more peace and more cooperation in pursuit of a common good,\" he added. </> \"I believe we have no choice but to move forward... I believe it is based on hard evidence. The fact that the world\\'s most prosperous and successful societies happen to be those which have most closely approximated the liberal progressive ideal that we talk about.\" </> Things may go backwards for a while, but - ultimately - right makes might,\" Mr Obama said. \"Not the other way around.\" </> \"Keep believing. Keep marching. Keep building. Keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world,\" Mr Obama said, ending his speech on a positive note. </> To loud cheers, he called on young people listening to him to get \"fired up\". </> \"We don\\'t just need one leader... what we badly need is that collective spirit,\" he added. </> \"Mandela said young people are capable when aroused of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom,\" he said. \"Now is a good time to be aroused.\" </> Barack Obama\\'s speech was part of events to mark 100 years since the birth of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela, who died in 2013 aged 95. </> Both men were the first black presidents of their countries. </> Mr Obama has said he was \"one of the countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela\\'s life\". </> Mandela led the fight against white minority rule in South Africa. He was imprisoned for 27 years before he became the country\\'s first democratically elected president in 1994. </> As a student, Mr Obama called the fight against apartheid \"a struggle that touches each and every one of us\", and  encouraged his university to drop its investments in South Africa. </> Since its beginning in 2003, global leaders have used the lecture to speak about issues affecting South Africa, the continent and the world.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> US President Donald Trump is postponing his first post-coronavirus lockdown election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma so it does not fall on a holiday commemorating the end of US slavery. </> He tweeted that the 19 June rally would be held a day later out of respect for the occasion, known as Juneteenth. </> The choice of date had drawn criticism amid nationwide anti-racism protests. </> The location was also controversial, as Tulsa saw one of the worst massacres of black people in US history in 1921. </> Up to 300 people died when a white mob attacked the prosperous black neighbourhood of Greenwood, known as the \"Black Wall Street\", with guns and explosives. About 1,000 businesses and homes were also destroyed. </> Juneteenth is not a federal holiday, but is widely celebrated by African Americans. </> It celebrates the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation to enslaved African Americans in Texas. </> Texas was the last state of the Confederacy - the slaveholding southern states that seceded, triggering the Civil War - to receive the proclamation, on 19 June 1865, months after the end of the war. </> President Trump initially defended the timing of his rally, telling Fox News: \"Think about it as a celebration. My rally is a celebration. In the history of politics, I think I can say there\\'s never been any group or any person that\\'s had rallies like I do.\" </> But critics accused him of disrespecting the date and the significance of Tulsa to US history.  </> \"This isn\\'t just a wink to white supremacists - he\\'s throwing them a welcome home party,\" said Democratic Senator Kamala Harris. </> Explaining the decision to move his rally, Mr Trump tweeted: \"Many of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out of respect for this Holiday, and in observance of this important occasion and all that it represents. I have therefore decided to move our rally to Saturday, June 20th, in order to honor their requests...\" </> The \"Make America Great Again\" rally in Tulsa will be the president\\'s first campaign event since 2 March, when the coronavirus pandemic put a halt to mass gatherings. </> Mr Trump is seeking re-election in November 2020, but polls show him lagging behind his Democratic rival, Joe Biden. </> Campaign rallies are seen as a key method of energising his base, and Oklahoma is traditionally a Republican-voting state. </> The event will proceed against a backdrop of ongoing protests against racial inequality and police brutality, triggered by the death of African American man George Floyd on 25 May. Mr Floyd, who was unarmed, died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota after a policeman knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. </> The rally is being held in a 19,000-seat indoor arena, and concerns have been raised about the potential risks.  </> The US has the world\\'s highest official death toll from coronavirus. More than 114,600 people have died there with the virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, and there have been more than two million confirmed infections.  </> Oklahoma has one of the country\\'s lowest infection rates, and businesses are reopening - but the state\\'s Governor Kevin Stitt has urged residents to keep social distancing and to \"minimise time spent in crowded environments\". </> People buying tickets for the Tulsa rally online have to click on a waiver confirming that they \"voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19\" and will not hold the president\\'s campaign responsible for \"any illness or injury\". </> Correspondents say that while the virus remains a threat, Mr Trump\\'s campaign considers that large crowds at the recent protests will make it harder for his opponents to criticise his rallies. </> The president has said he plans to hold further events in Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Arizona. </> Is Donald Trump\\'s re-election bid in peril? </> Polls indicate that the president is trailing Joe Biden - by double digits in some surveys. A recent Economist magazine analysis gives Biden a five in six chance of winning by an electoral margin reminiscent of Barack Obama\\'s comfortable win in 2008. </> Trump is running with the same strategy as in 2016, but his struggles suggest that this year the national mood may be different. The American public, grappling with more than 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, a resulting economic slump and now nationwide protests about racial injustice and policing, may have no stomach for further confrontation. The president\\'s bellicosity and bravado, which has served him in the past, at times seems out of step with a public that wants empathy, healing and reconciliation. </> The president is touting \"law and order\" at a time when public opinion has dramatically shifted in favour of the Black Lives Matter movement and toward the belief that racial and ethnic discrimination is a real problem that will be a priority when voting in November. </> Read more from Anthony here'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> Twitter has accused the US president of making false claims, in one of the app\\'s own articles covering the news. </> The move - which effectively accuses the leader of lying - refers to a tweet by Donald Trump about his first defence secretary. </> Mr Trump had tweeted  that he had given James Mattis the nickname \"Mad Dog\" and later fired him. </> But Twitter\\'s article says that the former general resigned, and his nickname preceded Trump\\'s presidency. </> It follows last week\\'s explosive confrontation, which saw Twitter fact-check two of President Trump\\'s tweets and label another as glorifying violence. </> The latest confrontation was prompted by a strongly-worded statement issued by General Mattis last night, in which he criticised the president\\'s handling of the protests that followed the killing of George Floyd. </> Gen Mattis described Donald Trump as \"the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us.\" </> The president fired back quickly in a tweet saying that the one thing he and predecessor Barack Obama had in common was \"we both had the honour of firing Jim Mattis, the world\\'s most overrated general. I asked for his letter of resignation and felt good about it\". </> \"His nickname was \\'Chaos\\', which I didn\\'t like, and changed it to \\'Mad Dog\\',\"  he added . </> Twitter later published what it calls a Moment, a summary of a news story that you can see when you press the platform\\'s search button. It has also been promoted within the What\\'s Happening box that appears on Twitter\\'s website. </> The article says that \"Mattis resigned from the position... after the administration decided to withdraw US troops from Syria\", and attributes the fact to a report by the Associated Press news agency. </> It then refers to journalists at CNN, the National Review, the Washington Post and The Dispatch as having written that the nickname \\'Mad Dog\\' had been used before Trump\\'s presidency, with published references dating back to 2004. </> Moments are curated by an internal team at Twitter. They provide a summary of a recent development before presenting some related tweets. </> This is not the first time the tool has been used to call out Donald Trump. </> In March 2019, it said the president  had misidentified a co-founder of Greenpeace , and in April 2020 it said he had falsely  claimed he could force states to reopen during the Covid-19 pandemic . </> But what is interesting here is that Twitter has chosen to raise the temperature of its clash with the president over what could be seen as a relatively minor issue.  </> It was on 20 December 2018 that Gen Mattis announced his resignation, effective from 28 February 2019.  </> A furious Mr Trump then announced his defence secretary was going from 1 January and stated he\\'d essentially fired him. So you could at least argue that, as in many cases, there is a blurry line between a resignation and a firing. </> Perhaps Twitter\\'s chief executive Jack Dorsey is looking on, with a degree of schadenfreude, at what has happened in recent days at Facebook.  </> There, Mark Zuckerberg\\'s determination not to follow Twitter\\'s lead and take some kind of action over the president\\'s posts has sparked open revolt. </> Facebook staff, who previously would only grumble anonymously about the company\\'s practices, have put their names to statements deploring Mr Zuckerberg\\'s failure to act.  </> This morning, nearly three dozen former employees, including some who had helped write the original guidelines on what can and cannot be posted,  published an open letter  accusing Mr Zuckerberg of a \"betrayal\" of Facebook\\'s ideals. </> Last week, it felt as though Twitter might be putting its future in danger by taking on the president.  </> This week, it feels as though Mr Zuckerberg\\'s failure to act might leave him facing an even bigger crisis than the Cambridge Analytica scandal.'},\n",

       "  'date_published': '5 Jun 2020',\n",
       "  'text': ' </> The US labour market improved unexpectedly in May raising hopes that economic damage tied to the pandemic will be less harmful than feared. </> The unemployment rate fell to 13.3%, down from 14.7% in April, as businesses started hiring again. </> Firms in the food, construction and health care sectors took on staff. </> In total, employers added 2.5 million jobs, with the education and retail sectors also recruiting. </> It came as US states started rolling back some of the tough measures put in place to control the spread of the coronavirus. </> As businesses start reopening, firms are beginning to rehire their employees. </> The job gains surprised economists, many of whom had warned the country could see the unemployment rate rise past 20% to a post-World War Two high. </> Economist Justin Wolfers, a professor at the University of Michigan, tweeted: \"It\\'s hard to escape the conclusion that the economy bottomed in early/mid May,\" he said. \"We\\'re in a massive and deep hole, and it\\'ll take a while to climb out, but at least the hole isn\\'t getting any deeper.\" </> President Donald Trump, who has maintained the economic rebound will be swift, immediately took to Twitter to celebrate the numbers and claim credit. </> \"Really Big Jobs Report. Great going President Trump (kidding but true)!\" he wrote. </> The gains go only a small way towards making up for the more than 21 million jobs US employers cut in March and April, as lockdowns forced many businesses to shut their doors. In April, the unemployment rate hit 14.7%, the highest level since the Great Depression in the 1930s. </> But Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said the report showed that the economic re-opening has been more robust than thought. </> \"It appears that the worst of the coronavirus\\'s impact on the nation\\'s job markets is behind us,\" he said. </> The news cheered investors, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 up more than 2%, continuing a recovery in share prices from their March lows. </> The job gains were not limited to the US.  </> In Canada, employers added 290,000 jobs - far more than expected. However, the unemployment rate shot to 13.7% - the highest level on record in data back to 1976. </> As recently as February, the jobless rate in the US was hovering at 50-year lows of 3.5%. </> On Friday, economists warned the path of the economic recovery still remained uncertain. They pointed out that the hiring in May came as the government released billions of dollars in emergency aid to businesses to cover wages for employees, encouraging recipients to recall staff. </> Hiring by restaurants and bars accounted for roughly half of the jobs created last month. Dentist offices accounted for another 10%. </> Many of the gains also came from individuals who had told surveyors that their layoffs were temporary. </> \"This means this was all the easy part of the recovery,\" said economist Jason Furman, a top economic advisor to President Barack Obama. </> The losses have hit minority and low-wage workers hardest, a trend that continued in May. </> Among white workers, the unemployment rate fell to 12.4% from 14.2% in April. Unemployment also declined among Hispanic workers, from 18.9% to 17.6%. </> For black workers, however, the unemployment rate ticked up from 16.7% to 16.8%. </> The US Labor Department has warned that the headline figures in recent months may underestimate the true jobless rate, due to discrepancies in how people describe their out-of-work status.  </> Economists say the unemployment rate is likely to still be about 10% at the end of the year - still quite high, and comparable to the peak following the financial crisis. </> \"We still think it will be a long time before the labour market is anywhere near back to its pre-virus state,\" said Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics. </> But at a press conference on Friday, Mr Trump rejected those forecasts. </> \"We\\'ll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world,\" he said. \"This is a rocket ship.\"'},\n",

She also damaged her vocal cords from screaming in horror. </> As her plus one, the schoolgirl will take grandmother Sharon Goodman, whose grand-daughter Olivia Campbell-Hardy died in the bombing. </> The decision to invite those with a close relationship to the couple but not \"an official list of political leaders\" was taken in consultation with the government, Kensington Palace said. </> By contrast the invitation list for the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 - reflecting the groom\\'s position as a future monarch - included foreign royals, Commonwealth governors-general, ambassadors, senior religious figures and many politicians from around the world. </> The then-Prime Minister David Cameron, deputy PM Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband were among those who attended.  </> US President Barack Obama was not a guest, but Australian PM Julia Gillard and New Zealand PM John Key were among the leaders from Commonwealth countries invited. </> Prince Harry\\'s wedding will be a very different occasion, as well as being considerably smaller, and an early decision was taken to invite members of the public into the castle grounds on the day. </> Individuals were chosen by the regional Lord Lieutenant offices after the couple asked for people with a range of backgrounds and ages. </> Those who have received an invitation to the outside area include Reuben Litherland, 14, from Derby, in recognition of his work for the deaf community. </> Reuben, who campaigns for deaf-friendly screenings at cinemas, said: \"I opened the letter and I couldn\\'t believe it... we danced around.\" </> Also invited is Pamela Anomneze, 52, from Haringey in north London, who works at an organisation which helps people with mental illness through art and crafts. </> The mother-of-three said she initially thought the invite was an \"April Fool\\'s prank\", adding it is \"truly unbelievable\". </> Ms Anomneze said she will take her son Jude, 15, as her plus one because he \"was down on his knees begging to go\" and saying: \"Oh mum, just to get a glimpse of Meghan Markle!\"\\'  </> Meanwhile, primary school teacher David Gregory from Blyth, Northumberland, who has started a recycling initiative and STEM club at his school, also received an invite. </> He will go to the castle in the suit he wore at his own wedding last May, as the next day marks his and his wife Hannah\\'s first anniversary. </> Members of the public who are on the guest-list are invited to bring their own picnic to the castle grounds. </> Rosie Grinday, the founder of the Birmingham-based social enterprise Miss Macaroon, was invited because of the training her business provides to disadvantaged young people. </> She said she will be taking some of her macaroons to the royal wedding as part of her picnic.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> Another senior former military officer has denounced President Donald Trump\\'s threat to use troops to suppress ongoing protests in the US. </> The ex-Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Gen Martin Dempsey, told National Public Radio that Mr Trump\\'s remarks were \"very troubling\" and \"dangerous\". </> Mr Trump\\'s current and former defence secretaries have also spoken out. </> On Monday, the president threatened to deploy the military to \"quickly solve\" the unrest if states failed to act. </> Mainly peaceful protests have spread across the US since the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody last month. </> While demonstrations over Mr Floyd\\'s death appear to be simmering down in the nation\\'s capital, the White House\\'s security perimeter has expanded in recent days. </> Police used batons and tear gas to clear protesters from nearby Lafayette Park on Monday, and have since erected high fences around the White House.  </> \"The idea that the president would take charge of the situation using the military was troubling to me,\" Gen Dempsey said in rare public remarks on Thursday. </> \"The idea that the military would be called in to dominate and to suppress what, for the most part, were peaceful protests - admittedly, where some had opportunistically turned them violent - and that the military would somehow come in and calm that situation was very dangerous to me,\" he added. </> Gen Dempsey served as America\\'s most senior military officer under former US President Barack Obama from 2011-15. </> His criticism comes a day after former Marine Gen Jim Mattis, Mr Trump\\'s former defence secretary, denounced the president,  saying he deliberately stoked division .  </> \"Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try,\" Mr Mattis wrote in the Atlantic magazine. \"Instead, he tries to divide us.\" </> Mr Trump hit back via Twitter at the \"overrated general\". </> Earlier that day, Mr Trump\\'s current Defence Secretary Mark Esper had also spoken up. </> He said the use of active-duty forces to quash unrest across the nation would be unnecessary at this stage, in remarks that are known to have displeased the White House. </> Mr Trump said on Monday from the White House Rose Garden that he would act to disperse violent protesters. </> \"If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,\" he said. </> While he spoke, authorities used force to disperse a mainly peaceful protest nearby so the president could walk to a historic church that was damaged by fire in the unrest and be photographed holding up a Bible. </> The justice department had ordered Lafayette Square, just outside the executive mansion, to be fenced off for Mr Trump\\'s walkabout. </> By Thursday afternoon, that security zone was significantly expanded, with high fencing installed around the park area known as the Ellipse just south of the White House. </> Also on Thursday, a moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski broke ranks to say she was unsure if she would support Mr Trump\\'s bid for re-election. </> In what is being seen as the most outspoken criticism yet of the president from a senator in his own party, Ms Murkowski told the Washington Post: \"I thought Gen Mattis\\'s words were true and honest and necessary and overdue.\" </> Shortly afterwards Mr Trump tweeted that he would campaign to throw the Alaska senator out of office when she is up for re-election in 2022. </> He later tweeted a letter written by his former lawyer John Dowd, apparently addressed to Mr Mattis, that referred to peaceful protesters in Washington as \"terrorists\". He also denounced John Kelly, his former White House Chief of staff, after the retired general also backed Mr Mattis. </> Meanwhile, the New York Times has said it was wrong to publish an opinion column by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton entitled, Send in the Troops.  </> It comes after dozens of journalists at the newspaper criticised the decision to run the piece, tweeting it put \"Black @nytimes staffers in danger\". </> The Times initially defended its publication of Sen Cotton\\'s column, which called for the military to be deployed against protesters - saying that  it wanted to provide readers with a range of opinions.  </> But the paper later issued a statement saying \"a rushed editorial process led to the publication of an Op-Ed that did not meet our standards\".'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> During the final Democratic primary debate in March, Joe Biden pledged that if he were to win the party\\'s presidential nomination, he would choose a woman as his running mate. </> A lot has happened since then, not the least of which is Biden securing the required Democratic Convention delegates to become his party\\'s presumptive nominee. Even before that point, however, speculation swirled around a dozen or so contenders to be Biden\\'s running mate. </> Buzz around the various candidates has risen and fallen as the nation has been buffeted by a viral pandemic, economic disruption and mass protests and racial tension. </> If the former vice-president follows through with his pledge, it would mark only the third time a major party has selected a woman for the number two spot - four years after Hillary Clinton became the first woman to be a presidential nominee. </> The move would suggest the Democrats are looking to secure the advantage they have among female voters according to polls, and perhaps insulate Biden from allegations that he engaged in unwanted physical contact with women. </> Biden has said he will announce his choice in early August. In the meantime, here are the current top contenders  - and how they stack up. </> Kamala Harris is widely considered the front-runner. She has a resume that includes time in the US Senate and as California\\'s attorney general, as well as San Francisco\\'s district attorney. She has a diverse background, with a mother from India and father from Jamaica. She\\'s at least been somewhat vetted by the national media, given that she ran for president last year and was considered, for a time, as a top-tier candidate. </> She did have a dust-up with Biden in the first primary debate last June, where she suggested his past views against desegregating schools through mandatory busing was hurtful, but that was a lifetime ago in modern US politics. </> Harris brings access to California money (she raised $2m for Biden in a recent virtual event), she\\'s quick on her feet, and she would satisfy those who are calling for Biden to add a black woman to the ticket. She has won praise from a wide range of Democrats for being an outspoken advocate for police reform during the recent mass demonstrations. Biden-Harris felt like the obvious ticket a year ago - and it still does. </> Just a few months ago, there wasn\\'t a lot of buzz around Gretchen Whitmer, a former state legislator in her second year as Michigan\\'s governor. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit, and she became the face of her state\\'s response, which included occasional criticism of what she viewed as the federal government\\'s lacklustre handling of the outbreak. That made her a target for Donald Trump\\'s vitriol - and elevated her national profile. </> Her decision to enact sweeping social distancing and business-shutdown measures as Michigan became one of the top US hotspots of the coronavirus outbreak also led to several angry conservative-organised protests in her state, boosting her standing among Democrats. </> In 2016 Hillary Clinton narrowly lost Michigan to Donald Trump - one of the upsets that helped decide the election. If Biden hopes to avoid a similar outcome, he might decide to put a Michigan native on the ticket. </> Tammy Duckworth, the junior senator from Illinois, has a CV that jumps off the page. She lost both her legs when the Army helicopter she was piloting was shot down by insurgents in Iraq. She stayed in the military and retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel, before becoming an assistant secretary in President Barack Obama\\'s Department of Veteran Affairs. </> Duckworth served in the House of Representatives and then won her Senate seat in 2016. She is the first Thai-American woman elected to Congress, as well as the first double-amputee woman. In 2018 she became the first woman to give birth while serving in the Senate. </> Illinois is a safe Democratic state, but its proximity to key Midwest battlegrounds - as well as her middle-of-the-road politics - could make her an attractive pick for Biden. </> Elizabeth Warren\\'s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination is a story of what might have been. Her \"I have a plan for that\" mantra seemed to strike a chord with Democrats, and she led the polls for months in mid-2019, drawing enthusiastic crowds and cruising through the early debates with seeming ease. Then her support faded, as many progressives drifted back to Bernie Sanders, while moderates opted for younger candidates like Pete Buttigieg. </> Many progressives expected her to endorse Sanders when she dropped out of the race in early March, so her decision to hold back may have earned her some appreciation from the Biden team. </> Now they have the opportunity to return the favour by offering Warren the running-mate spot. While there was some friction between the Sanders and Warren camps, Warren would still be a significant signal that Biden wants to reach out to his party\\'s left wing - and govern as more of a progressive than he let on during the campaign. </> With the nation facing a serious economic crisis, Warren could lend some liberal policy heft to the Democratic ticket. </> Four years ago, Hillary Clinton was lambasted for never campaigning in Wisconsin during the general election, then losing the pivotal state to Donald Trump as her Midwest Democratic \"blue wall\" crumbled. Democrats have pledged not to repeat that mistake, going so far as to pick Milwaukee as the site of their (now delayed) national convention. </> If Biden wants to lean into the whole \"don\\'t ignore Wisconsin\" theme, he couldn\\'t do much better than to pick an actual Wisconsinite as his running mate. Tammy Baldwin is in her second term as one of the state\\'s senators, having served in the House of Representatives for 14 years prior to that. </> Her selection would also be historic, as she would become the first openly gay person to serve on a major party\\'s ticket - just as she became the first openly gay member of the Senate. In a season where Pete Buttigieg, who is also gay, proved to be a potent electoral force in Democratic politics, there may be particular appeal for such a move. </> There\\'s a line of thought among Democrats that this election\\'s Wisconsin is not, in fact, Wisconsin, it\\'s Arizona. The desert state, they say, will be the \"tipping point\" that delivers the election to Biden, freeing him from worrying about fickle Wisconsin voters.  Polls suggest Biden\\'s brand of political moderation, combined with Donald Trump\\'s divisive rhetoric on immigration, have the state leaning toward the Democrats. One strategy for securing that lead would be to put an Arizonan on the ticket. </> In 2018, Kyrsten Sinema became the first Democrat to win an Arizona Senate seat in 30 years. She\\'s young, telegenic and politically centrist - perhaps too centrist, according to the party\\'s left-wing activists. </> She is a bit quirky - turning heads recently when she wore a purple wig on the floor of the Senate. It could present a beneficial contrast with the often staid Biden. </> If Biden picks her as his running mate, she would make history as the first openly bisexual person on a presidential ticket. </> Last year, Val Demings was a little-known Democratic back-bencher in Congress. Then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave her a high-visibility role as one of the impeachment managers - the congressional equivalent of prosecutors - during Donald Trump\\'s January Senate trial. </> Even before the mass protests over the death of George Floyd made racial justice a top issue among voters, the black former chief-of-police from Orlando, Florida, was on the Biden team\\'s radar as a possible vice-presidential pick. Now she\\'s getting more than just a passing mention. </> Cutting against her is her relative lack of political experience and low name recognition. But if Biden feels she can hold up under the intense scrutiny of being on a national ticket, she could be the woman for this particular national moment - and a signal that Biden is serious about making tackling racism and police reform his top issues. </> During the primaries, Hispanics were consistently one of Biden\\'s weakest voting blocs. In states like California, Texas and Nevada, liberal champion Bernie Sanders outpaced Biden among a demographic that is well represented in numerous states that will be battlegrounds in the November general election. </> If Biden decides he needs to shore up his support among one of the fastest-growing segments of the US electorate, New Mexico\\'s first-term governor Michelle Lujan Grisham is the most obvious choice for a running mate now that Senator Catherine Cortez Masto has said she\\'s not interested. </> Unlike Masto\\'s Nevada, New Mexico is a reliable Democratic state in presidential races, with few electoral votes. Lujan was comfortably elected governor after Republicans held the office for two terms, however. The 60-year-old Lujan previously served in Congress and as her state\\'s health secretary - a helpful CV entry in the pandemic age. </> Stacey Abrams doesn\\'t have much of a traditional political CV for a vice-presidential pick. She spent 10 years as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives. She ran and narrowly lost the 2018 race to be the state\\'s governor - a defeat she attributed, in part, to what she alleges was voter suppression by her Republican opponent. </> What Abrams has, however, is a voice that has resonated powerfully with much of the Democratic base. Her activism on voting rights has helped boost it as an issue for the party. She gave the Democratic response to Donald Trump\\'s 2019 State of the Union Address, making her the first black woman chosen for the task. </> Unlike her rivals, Abrams has actively campaigned to be Biden\\'s vice-presidential pick - a move that has elicited cringes from some, while others see it as refreshing honesty. Abrams is a rising star within the party, the face of a demographic segment of the Democratic Party that has traditionally been underrepresented in leadership positions. Even if she doesn\\'t become the pick, the early buzz around her has helped advance the prospects of all the black women under Biden\\'s consideration. </> The nationwide protests over George Floyd\\'s death while in the custody of Minneapolis police gave a handful of big-city mayors a national platform, as they dealt with difficult issues of racism, law enforcement and civil unrest in their jurisdictions. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, in particular, proved particularly adept at balancing official responsibilities while expressing her personal experiences as a black woman raising four children in these turbulent times. </> A heartfelt Vice interview, in which she explained the challenge of having to tell her 12-year-old son not to play with toy guns lest he provoke an incident with police, was praised as both raw and powerful. </> A first-term mayor would be an unconventional pick for Biden, but Bottoms is from Georgia - a traditionally conservative state that is trending toward being an electoral battleground. She\\'s also won praise from Democrats for waging political battles with the state\\'s Republican governor over when and how to ease business closures and shelter-in-place orders during the coronavirus pandemic. </> Susan Rice is a bit of a surprise entry on this list, given that she has no experience holding elected office or campaigning in general, and is a relative unknown for most Americans. The diplomat is well-known to Biden, however, as she served in the Obama White House with him as national security adviser after a stint as the US representative to the United Nations. </> If Rice is the pick, she could play a key role in a Biden foreign policy team, suggesting that international relations will be a focus for his administration. </> Rice was a lightning rod for criticism during her Obama years, however. Republicans accused her of deceiving the American public about the reasons behind the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi that resulted in the death of the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans. </> Reports that the Biden team has already vetted Rice for the vice-presidential slot suggests the campaign is casting a wide net in looking for a black woman running mate. </> The traditional first rule for selecting a vice-president is to do no harm. Given that the choice doesn\\'t offer much of a boost to the ticket, the theory goes, it is better to pick someone safe, who minimises the risk of embarrassment and won\\'t overshadow the presidential nominee. </> Most of the other candidates on this list fall somewhere on the \"very safe\" to \"mostly safe\" spectrum. Former US First Lady Michelle Obama is in a category by herself. </> She\\'s beloved by a large swathe of the American public and is a near universally recognisable figure. Yes, she might steal the stage from Biden, but what better way for Biden to cast himself as the continuation of Obama\\'s presidential legacy than to put his wife on the ticket? </> A Biden-Obama ticket would electrify the Democratic base - particularly black voters who turned out in record numbers for Obama-Biden in 2008 and 2012.  </> The only kink in such a bold plan is that Michelle Obama has shown less than zero interest in entering politics. In her autobiography she frequently complained about the toll her husband\\'s political career took on her life and marriage - and she seems very happy to have those travails in the rear-view mirror.     </> Follow Anthony on Twitter'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell has strongly criticised President Donald Trump\\'s handling of anti-racism protests, saying he has \"drifted away\" from the constitution. </> The Republican, a former top military officer, is the latest to condemn Mr Trump\\'s response, including his threats to use the army to quell unrest. </> He said he would vote for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in November\\'s poll. </> President Trump responded by calling Mr Powell \"highly overrated\". </> Mr Powell, the only African American so far to have served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has joined a growing list of former top military officials to have launched scathing attacks on President Trump. </> It comes amid days of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. </> On Sunday, nine of 13 Minneapolis City Council members pledged in front of hundreds of protesters to dismantle the local police department and instead create \"a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe\". </> Meanwhile, security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. New York ended its nearly week-long curfew, and Mr Trump said he was ordering the National Guard to start withdrawing from Washington DC. </> Speaking on CNN\\'s State of the Union on Sunday, Mr Powell said:  \"We have a constitution. And we have to follow that constitution. And the president has drifted away from it.\" </> Referring to President Trump, the retired four-star general said: \"He lies about things, and he gets away with it because people will not hold him accountable.\" </> Mr Powell also said the president\\'s rhetoric is a danger to American democracy and said, referring to this year\\'s presidential election: \"I certainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year.\" </> He added: \"I\\'m very close to Joe Biden in a social matter and political matter. I worked with him for 35, 40 years. And he is now the candidate, and I will be voting for him.\" </> Mr Powell, who is seen as a moderate Republican, did not vote for Mr Trump in the 2016 poll. </> In the interview, he also backed America\\'s military leaders who had criticised Mr Trump in recent days.  </> Gen Martin Dempsey, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman under Barack Obama, told ABC\\'s The Week earlier on Sunday that the president\\'s words had hurt relations between the US public and the military. </> And  former Defence Secretary James Mattis last week accused Mr Trump of deliberately stoking division,  saying he \"angry and appalled\" by Mr Trump\\'s handling of the protests. </> On Twitter, Mr Trump said Colin Powell was \"a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars\", referring to the 1990-93 Gulf War and the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003. </> Mr Biden also took to Twitter  to hit out at Mr Trump\\'s handling of the protests, saying he had \"callously used his [words as a president] to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart\". </> Former Secretary of State  Condoleezza Rice told CBS News\\' Face the Nation  that she would like Mr Trump to \"put tweeting aside for a little bit\" and have a conversation with the American people. </> \"Not everyone is going to agree with any president, with this president, but you have to speak to every American, not just to those who might agree with you,\" she said. </> The unrest in the US has largely been replaced by peaceful worldwide demonstrations, with Black Lives Matter protests staged in European nations on Sunday. </> In the city of Bristol in the UK protesters  tore down a statue of Edward Colston, a prominent 17th Century slave trader. </> On Saturday, huge peaceful rallies took place across the US, including in Washington DC, Chicago and San Francisco. There was even a protest in the Texas town of Vidor, once infamous as a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group. </> George Floyd, 46, died in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May.

       "  'text': ' </> For more than a week, protests have shaken cities across the US following the death of a black man in police custody. </> George Floyd, 46, was arrested in the city of Minneapolis on 25 May for allegedly using counterfeit money to buy a pack of cigarettes. He died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, while he pleaded that he could not breathe. </> The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has been dismissed from the police department and charged with murder. Three other officers who were on the scene were also sacked and later charged with abetting the crime.  </> Unrest has broken out across the country. Police have used tear gas and force against demonstrators and President Donald Trump has threatened to send in the military. </> Here, we look at some of the context that will help you understand the fuller picture of what is happening. </> There are numerous recent examples of African-American people being killed by law enforcement officers in the US. </> High-profile cases from recent years include  Philando Castile ,  Terence Crutcher ,  Michael Brown  and  Alton Sterling . In these cases the officers involved were not convicted of any criminal offence. </> \"I\\'m tired of hearing about black people dying,\" one protester in Washington DC said. \"I\\'m tired of being afraid just by being stopped by the cops.\" </> In particular, the George Floyd case has drawn comparisons with the death of Eric Garner in July 2014. </> Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, was arrested in New York on suspicion of illegally selling loose cigarettes. In a video recorded by a bystander, white police officer Daniel Pantaleo can be seen with his arm wrapped around Garner\\'s neck in a chokehold. </> Garner, an asthmatic, was heard repeatedly saying \"I can\\'t breathe\" before appearing to lose consciousness. He was later pronounced dead in hospital. </> A state grand jury declined to charge the officer with murder. </> The case sparked nationwide protests, but the officer never faced any criminal charges and  lost his job in 2019 - five years after Garner\\'s death . </> In the case of George Floyd, the speed with which the officers involved were fired, and with which Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged, was unusual. </> Former US President Barack Obama said the protests over Floyd\\'s death  represented a \"genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system.\" </> Data  collated by the BBC\\'s Reality Check team  highlights how the experience of African Americans differs from white Americans when it comes to law and order. </> In 2019, African Americans made up less than 14% of the population but accounted for more than 23% of the just over 1,000 fatal shootings by the police. </> African Americans are arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans even though surveys show drug use at similar levels for both groups. </> In 2018, African Americans represented almost a third of the country\\'s prison population.  </> This means there are more than 1,000 African-American inmates in federal or state prisons for every 100,000 African Americans, while there are about 200 white inmates for every 100,000 white Americans. </> Data from Minneapolis, where Floyd lived, also reflect these law enforcement trends. </> George Floyd\\'s death did not happen in a vacuum. It came on the heels of several other high-profile incidents just in the past few weeks that have provoked debates about racism in the country. </> On the same day as his death, a video went viral of  a white woman in New York\\'s Central Park calling the police after a black man asked her to put her dog on a lead . </> An exchange between the two started because Christian Cooper, a bird watcher, was concerned that the dog could endanger wildlife. He filmed Amy Cooper (no relation) threatening to call the police and tell them \"there\\'s an African-American man threatening my life\". </> After calling the emergency operator she repeated, \"He\\'s African American,\" before pleading for them to send an officer. </> Ms Cooper was fired from her job and widely condemned. </> In a later interview with NBC News, Mr Cooper  raised the recent high-profile shooting of Ahmaud Arbery , a 25-year-old black man who was out jogging when he was killed by two white men in February. A third man filmed the shooting. </> The case gained widespread attention in the national media and provoked outrage. </> It took more than two months  for the suspects to be charged .  </> \"We live in an age of Ahmaud Arbery, where black men are gunned down because of assumptions people make about black men, black people, and I\\'m just not going to participate in that,\" Mr Cooper said. </> Racial divisions in US society are also prevalent in areas such as housing, healthcare and employment. </> In 2016, the typical net worth of a white family was found to be  nearly 10 times greater than that of a black family . Compared with white Americans,  African Americans are almost twice as likely not to have medical insurance . </> African Americans are more likely to work in service industry jobs and to live in densely populated areas. </> These issues have all contributed to African Americans being disproportionately affected by the coronavirus outbreak, which is happening at the same time as the Floyd protests. George Floyd\\'s autopsy concluded he had coronavirus, although this played no part in his death. </> According to the most recent government data  more than 34% of those in hospital with coronavirus are black , out of 19,775 cases where race and ethnicity data were available. </> New York City has reported that rates of Covid-19 deaths are substantially higher among African Americans than white Americans. </> Rates of unemployment during the pandemic, as before,  are also higher among African Americans than white Americans . George Floyd lost his job as a bouncer as a result of the coronavirus shutdown. </> \"The coronavirus does not discriminate, but our housing, economic, and health care policies do,\" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America\\'s Black Cities.  </> \"Environmental racism, unaffordable housing, a lack of job opportunities, poverty, and inadequate health care are underlying social conditions, strongly influenced by policy, which place black people and their neighbourhoods at risk.\" </> Such socio-economic inequality  also exists in Minneapolis  - the city where Floyd died and where the protests began. </> Minneapolis has a population of about 430,000 people, less than 20% of whom are black.  </> Even before layoffs caused by the pandemic, 10% of black residents of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul were unemployed compared with 4% of whites.  </> In 2016, 32% of black people living there fell below the poverty line compared with 6.5% of whites. </> Neighbourhoods there are highly segregated and black home ownership is among the lowest in the country. </> \"The same attitudes that led a cop to kneel in the back of a black man\\'s neck, choking him out are the same attitudes held by people in housing markets who facilitate the region\\'s black-white homeownership gap of 46% to 79%,\" said Mr Perry. </> Donald Trump\\'s presidency began with massive, nationwide protests. Now, it could be ending with them. </> The women\\'s marches of January 2017 brought hundreds of thousands to US streets for largely peaceful demonstrations. Following George Floyd\\'s death, the protests in the nation\\'s capital, and across the country, have at times turned violent. And while the 2017 events were in direct reaction to Trump\\'s inauguration, the purpose of latest uprising - addressing racial injustice and policing practices - are not specifically about the president. </> The president has taken the demonstrations personally, however. Like the women\\'s marches, his actions suggest he views the Floyd marches as an attempt to undermine his presidency. The first set the stage for his administration, and these latest come just five months before he hopes to be re-elected to a second four-year term. </> The politics of the situation has clearly influenced the tenor of his response. He echoed a pledge to restore \"law and order\" that Richard Nixon used successfully in his 1968 and 1972 presidential victories. Trump\\'s controversial decision to clear protesters and stand for photographs with a Bible in front of a church near the White House hints at a desire to court the evangelical voters he needs in November. </> Although the root causes of the Floyd protests predate the Trump presidency, the president - by his words and actions, intentional or not - have added fuel the storm.  </> The protests over George Floyd\\'s death have drawn attention to the use of military equipment by police officers. While images of military vehicles being used for crowd control may appear shocking to some, it is not a new phenomenon in the US. </> The Department of Defense began a programme in the 1990s allowing the transfer of excess military equipment to police departments. Preference is meant to be given to anti-drug and counter-terror needs. </> Today  more than 8,000 federal and state law enforcement agencies participate in the programme . </> It is overseen by the Defense Logistics Agency, which has the final authority over the type and quantity of equipment made available to different agencies. It does not specify how such equipment should be used. </> Data show that surplus military equipment transferred to local law enforcement agencies under the 1033 programme has been rising since the mid-2000s, with spikes after 2010.  </> As of 2015, more than $5bn worth of military equipment had been distributed to law enforcement agencies under the programme. </> Paul Poast, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said prior to the mid-2000s much US military equipment was \"simply not as usable for law enforcement\". </> \"With the start of counter-insurgency fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, manufacturers began to develop weapons that one could say had more \\'dual-use\\': be usable in urban counter-insurgency environments and usable by urban law enforcement. </> \"The surge starting in the 2010s can be explained by both the popularity of the equipment and the beginning of drawing down troops in Iraq. With less need for such equipment in Iraq, the equipment needed to go somewhere,\" he said. </> Former President Barack Obama barred the military from handing over some types of equipment after criticism that police were too heavy-handed in dealing with  protests in Ferguson, Missouri , that followed the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in 2014. </> But Mr Trump lifted the restrictions in 2017 . </> Equipment given out under the programme includes aircraft, armoured vehicles and bullet-proof helmets. </> Mr Poast said the use of military equipment by police was a key example of how large-scale counter-insurgency campaigns abroad can influence domestic security policy.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> A lawyer for George Floyd has told a memorial service that a \"pandemic of racism\" led to his death. </> Those gathered at Thursday\\'s tribute stood in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd was alleged to be on the ground under the control of police in Minneapolis. </> Hundreds attended the service, which also heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. </> It was time to stand up and say \"get your knee off our necks\", he said. </> Mr Floyd\\'s killing, which was captured on video, has caused outrage and sparked a wave of protests in cities across the US. </> Meanwhile, a few blocks away, three police officers charged with aiding and abetting Mr Floyd\\'s murder made their first appearance in court. Bail was set at $1m (£800,000) but would be lowered to $750,000 if they handed in any guns they owned and met other conditions, the judge said. </> Derek Chauvin, the officer who continued to kneel on Mr Floyd\\'s neck as he pleaded that he could not breathe, has been charged with second-degree murder and is due to appear in court on Monday. </> The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful, but some have descended into violence and rioting, with curfews imposed in a number of cities. </> Addressing Thursday\\'s memorial service, lawyer Benjamin Crump said it was \"not the coronavirus pandemic that killed George Floyd\". </> \"It was that other pandemic,\" he said. \"The pandemic of racism and discrimination.\" </> Members of Mr Floyd\\'s family, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were among several hundred people at the service at North Central University in downtown Minneapolis. </> Philonise Floyd, one of Mr Floyd\\'s brothers, described how the family had been poor when he and Mr Floyd were young and had washed their clothes in the sink and dried them in the oven. </> \"It\\'s crazy man, all these people came to see my brother, it\\'s amazing he touched so many hearts,\" he said. </> Reverend Al Sharpton meanwhile demanded accountability. </> \"We won\\'t stop,\" he said, referring to protests that have taken place in every US state. \"We\\'re going to keep going until we change the whole system of justice.\" </> In an emotional eulogy, he said Mr Floyd\\'s story had echoed that of black people in America. </> \"What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country, in education, in health services and in every area of American life. It\\'s time for us to stand up in George\\'s name and say: get your knee off our necks,\" he said. </> Further tributes will be held at Mr Floyd\\'s birthplace of North Carolina on Saturday, and in his hometown of Houston on Monday. </> In his first video comments since Mr Floyd\\'s death, former President Barack Obama said the demonstrations were as profound as anything he had seen in his lifetime, and called on Americans to seize the chance to deal with underlying problems in society. </> \"Too often some of that violence has come from folks who were supposed to be serving and protecting you,\" Mr Obama said. </> \"I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter, your dreams matter.\" </> The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, has also issued a personal message  about Mr Floyd\\'s death, saying his life mattered and recent events had been devastating. </> George Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. </> A video showed Mr Floyd being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. </> Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands and  in the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. </> Mr Floyd\\'s death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. </> For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd\\'s death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination.  </> Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews.  </> They have been largely peaceful, with cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago relaxing their restrictions amid hopes that the worst of the violence had passed. </> A post-mortem examination has revealed that Mr Floyd had the coronavirus in early April. But officials stressed that this played no role in his death.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> It\\'s been a rough few weeks for Donald Trump. A spate of polls with bad news, reports of turmoil in his campaign. And his presidency has been beset by a seemingly interminable series of crises. Is his re-election bid in serious peril? </> Donald Trump is an instinctual politician. Four years ago, he jumped into the deep end of the electoral pool and - defying all expectations and predictions - won his party\\'s presidential nomination and, subsequently, the White House. </> Such a feat, needless to say, would give a person a high regard for his own judgement. In hindsight, it would be easy for Trump to see a clear line from his descent on that golden escalator in July 2015 through all the controversies, name-calling, feuding, intemperate tweeting and associated drama, to his come-from-behind victory in November. </> The experts were wrong. He was right. </> Trump was certainly right about the big things. He ran as an outsider during an election where the national mood was tilted against the political establishment. He sensed this and capitalised on it, but his success may have glossed over any mistakes or missteps made along the way. </> Fast forward four years, and the president\\'s instincts this time around may be betraying him. He appears to want a replay of his 2016 victory - painting himself as the anti-establishment candidate doing battle with a \"Washington swamp\" opponent. His moves cater to his political base, which worked to his advantage last time because it drove up his side\\'s turnout in key states, while on-the-fence voters and traditional conservatives gave him the benefit of the doubt. </> The undecided voters, when they cast their ballots, broke decidedly in his favour. </> Now, however, Trump is a known quantity. His loyal base - which appears to be between 30% and 40% of the electorate, according to polls - will not be enough if he continues to haemorrhage support from the elderly, educated suburban residents and religious voters. </> The moves the president has made, however, have been out of the 2016 playbook - stoking controversy, instigating fights over social issues, advancing conspiracy theories and \"counter-punching\" to any and all criticism. </> Polls indicate the president is trailing Biden - by double digits in some surveys. A recent  Economist magazine analysis  gives Biden a five in six chance of winning by an electoral margin reminiscent of Barack Obama\\'s comfortable win in 2008. </> Trump is running with the same strategy as 2016, but his struggles suggest that this year the national mood may be different. The American public, grappling with more than 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, a resulting economic slump and now nationwide protests about racial injustice and policing may have no stomach for further confrontation. The president\\'s bellicosity and bravado, which has served him in the past, at times seems out of step with a public that wants empathy, healing and reconciliation. </> The president is touting \"law and order\" at a time when public opinion has dramatically  shifted in favour  of the Black Lives Matter movement and toward  the belief that racial and ethnic discrimination is a real problem  that will be a priority when voting in November. </> A \"law and order\" campaign may have been Richard Nixon\\'s key to presidential victories during years of civil unrest in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but this is not the same nation it was 50 years ago. </> Just a few episodes over the past few weeks reveal the current political state of play. </> On Thursday,  Trump emphatically ruled out removing the names of Confederate generals  from 10 US military bases in the south, saying it disrespected the soldiers trained there.  </> At the same time, the Nascar car-racing circuit - which started in the south and is hugely popular there - announced it was banning the display of the Confederate flag from all its events. Local and state leaders have taken steps to remove Confederate statues, and the call for the base name change came from within the ranks of the  US military, most notably in  an Atlantic Magazine essay  by retired General David Petreaus. </> The ground is shifting in another cultural fight the president has relished in the past, over professional athletes kneeling during the national anthem to protest unjust policing practices. The National Football League has officially expressed regrets over not supporting its players who took part in such protests, including former quarterback Colin Kaepernick. </> The US Soccer Federation voted on Wednesday to  repeal a requirement that all players \"stand respectfully\" during the national anthem . Democrats, who shied away from the controversy, are now kneeling in solidarity. Meanwhile, Trump continues to condemn the practice - and took aim at the NFL and quarterback Drew Brees after he recently apologised for calling the kneeling unpatriotic.   </> Just under two weeks ago, law enforcement and National Guard troops forcibly cleared a park by the White House shortly before the president walked to a nearby church and posed for photographers with a Bible. Since then, he has continued to defend the move, noting how easy it was for the security forces to clear the park\\'s occupants. </> \"A walk in the park,\" he tweeted. </> Meanwhile, civilian leaders and uniformed members of the US military have been distancing themselves from the incident. Numerous retired generals, including former Defence Secretary James Mattis, have called the actions reckless. Both current Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Mark Milley have expressed regret over accompanying Trump in his walk to the church. </> The New York Times  reports widespread unease among the National Guard members dispatched to provide security in Washington DC last week. </> Perhaps the most jarring episode, however, involved the president alleging in a tweet that a 75-year-old protester video recorded being shoved to the ground and left bleeding from his head by Buffalo, New York, police was a radical leftist saboteur attempting to conduct electronic surveillance of law enforcement. The allegation, drawn from far-right fringe media, left many of the president\\'s Republican supporters pleading ignorance or disavowing the tweet. </> It has left some wondering whether the president, through his actions and inactions, but mostly through the way he has conducted himself during a time of crisis, has created an insurmountable obstacle to his re-election. </> \"If he loses in November, it won\\'t because he pursued a big legislative reform that was a bridge too far politically,\" writes Rich Lowery, editor of the conservative National Review  in Politico magazine .  </> \"It won\\'t be because he adopted a creative and unorthodox policy mix that alienated his own side. It won\\'t even be because he was overwhelmed by events, challenging though they\\'ve been. It will mostly be because he took his presidency and needlessly drove it into the ground, 280 characters at a time.\" </> It is still more than four and a half months until the presidential election - a lifetime in ordinary political terms and a near-eternity in the current environment. There is still the possibility that Trump can find his footing, or Biden can catastrophically lose his. </> The Democrat\\'s lead over Trump so far, however, has been durable - more so than Hillary Clinton\\'s in 2016. The president\\'s standing may be at an ebb after several weeks of bad news, but his highs haven\\'t been high enough to make him a favourite. </> For the president to have a result similar to 2016, he may have to abandon his 2016 outlook and convince Americans that he can be more than the president they have now, but rather the one they would want for the next four years. </> Read more from Anthony'},\n",

By 1983, he tells her: \"I think of you often, though I stay confused about my feelings.\" </> \"It seems we will ever want what we cannot have; that\\'s what binds us; that\\'s what keeps us apart.\" </> In one letter, a young Obama writes about his friends preparing to settle down or take over the family business. </> But born in Hawaii, to a father from Kenya, and spending much of his early years in Indonesia, he felt different. </> \"I must admit large dollops of envy,\" he wrote.  </> \"Caught without a class, a structure, or a tradition to support me, in a sense the choice to take a different path is made for me.\" </> \"The only way to assuage my feelings of isolation are to absorb all the traditions, classes, make them mine, me theirs.\" </> But it was not so easy. </> As a graduate in 1983, returning to Indonesia where he grew up, he found that he no longer belonged there. \"I can\\'t speak the language well anymore,\" he said. </> \"I\\'m treated with a mixture of puzzlement, deference and scorn because I\\'m American - my money and my plane ticket back to the US overriding my blackness.\"  </> \"I see old dim roads, rickety homes winding back towards the fields, old routes of mine, routes I no longer have access to.\" </> The young graduate knew he wanted to work in the kind of community projects he would later champion as president - but, like many young people, had to be practical. </> \"One week I can\\'t pay postage to mail a resume and writing sample, the next I have to bounce a cheque to rent a typewriter,\" he wrote in 1983. </> \"Salaries in the community organisations are too low to survive on right now, so I hope to work in some more conventional capacity for a year, allowing me to store up enough nuts to pursue those interests next.\" </> Taking a job at publishing house Business International, he said he  became \"one of the \\'promising young men\\'... with everyone slapping my back and praising my work\". </> But he worried the corporate job might have \"dulled my senses or done irreparable damage to my values\" and left shortly afterwards. </> And there were other signs in his writing of who he might become. In a 1984 letter to Alexandra, he pondered what he could do with more influence. </> \"My ideas aren\\'t as crystallised as they were while in school, but they have an immediacy and weight that may be more useful if and when I\\'m less observer and more participant,\" he said.'},\n",

Mr Linick was the third official responsible for monitoring government misconduct to be dismissed in recent weeks. </> The former prosecutor was appointed by Mr Trump\\'s predecessor, Barack Obama, to oversee spending and detect mismanagement at the state department. </> On Saturday, top Democrats on the House and Senate Foreign Relations Committees questioned the timing of Mr Linick\\'s removal and announced an immediate investigation. </> \"We unalterably oppose the politically-motivated firing of inspectors general and the president\\'s gutting of these critical positions,\" Congressman Eliot Engel and Senator Bob Menendez said in a statement. </> They said Mr Linick had \"opened an investigation into wrongdoing by Secretary Pompeo himself\", adding that his firing was \"transparently designed to protect Secretary Pompeo from personal accountability\". </> Mr Linick had begun investigating allegations that Mr Pompeo had improperly used staff to run personal errands, US media report. </> Mr Engel and Mr Menendez have requested that the White House and State Department hand over all records related to his dismissal by next Friday. </> Meanwhile, on Saturday, the White House said the decision to oust Mr Linick was prompted by Mr Pompeo himself. \"Secretary Pompeo recommended the move, and President Trump agreed,\" an official said. </> Mr Trump sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in which he declared his intention to fire Mr Linick. </> Under federal law, the Trump administration must give Congress 30 days\\' notice of its plans to fire an inspector general. It is expected that Mr Linick will leave his post after this time, with some reports suggesting a political ally of Mr Trump is being lined up to replace him. </> \"It is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general. That is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general,\" Mr Trump said in the letter. </> Not long after Mr Linick\\'s dismissal was announced, Mr Engel, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Mr Linick had opened an investigation into Mr Pompeo. </> \"Mr Linick\\'s firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation,\" he said in a statement. </> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr Linick was \"punished for honourably performing his duty to protect the constitution and our national security\". </> It was the latest in a series of dismissals of independent government watchdogs. </> Last month,  Mr Trump dismissed Michael Atkinson , the inspector general of the intelligence community. </> Mr Atkinson first alerted Congress to a whistleblower complaint that led to Mr Trump\\'s impeachment trial.'},\n",

Scientists made the distinction in honour of Mr Obama\\'s support for science education.  </> An  Irish countryside service station  located in County Offaly, between Dublin and Limerick, was officially named for the US president.  </> The Barack Obama Plaza includes a petrol station, food court and visitor centre that provides information on Mr Obama\\'s connections to Moneygall. </> Ahead of Mr Obama\\'s visit to Ireland in 2011, bakers rushed to create Irish \"Brack\" bread - something Americans might refer to as a fruit loaf. </> Moneygall resident Joseph Kearney delivered fresh orders to Mr Obama\\'s ancestral Irish family members preparing for \"O\\'Bama\\'s\" visit. </> A Western Striolated puffbird, known as  Nystalus obamai , is also named in honour of the president. The bird is found in western Amazonia. </> A Kenyan school in the village of Kogelo, where Mr Obama\\'s father was born and buried, bears the name of Mr Obama.  </> The Senator Obama Kogelo Primary School and Senator Obama Kogelo Secondary School were named in his honour while he was an Illinois politician.  </> A trapdoor spider,  Aptostichus barackobamai , was also named for Mr Obama, a known Spider-Man fan.  </> The spider species, which is found in California, is one of 40 that belong to the genus Aptostichus.  </> Other notable species include  Aptostichus stephencolberti  and  Aptostichus angelinajolieae .'},\n",

Restaurants, schools and even children were named after him. </> During his two terms he went to seven countries in the four visits he made to Africa - more than any other US president.  </> He also became the first sitting American president to visit Kenya and Ethiopia. </> His administration increased military support to Somalia, Cameroon and Chad to fight al-Shabab and Boko Haram respectively, and established military outposts in more than 10 African countries. </> But it is America\\'s intervention in Libya that attracted the most attention - and criticism, for leaving the country deeply unstable.  </> Mr Obama himself said that the aftermath of intervention in Libya was his \"biggest foreign policy regret\". </> In a town hall meeting in 2016 he confessed: \"I did a little too much counting on other countries to then stabilise and help support government formation, and now it\\'s kind of a mess.\" </> \"Trade not aid\" was the cornerstone of US policy for Africa under Mr Obama, a point he emphasised in an interview with the BBC in 2015 saying: </> \"People are not interested in just being patrons or being patronised and being given aid - they\\'re interested in building capacity\". </> Perhaps in keeping with this sentiment, the $8bn (£6bn) of aid that the US spent in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015 is relatively small compared to other countries.  </> Afghanistan ($5.5 billion) and Israel ($3.1 billion) together received more aid from America than the 42 African countries south of the Sahara. </> In 2013 President Obama launched the Power Africa initiative, to try to double access to electricity across sub-Saharan Africa using renewable sources.  </> The target is to add 30,000 megawatts by 2030. The project has only generated 2,000 megawatts so far, but energy businesses operating in Africa say the programme has boosted investor confidence.  </> Its future under a new administration is in some doubt.  </> In an apparent reference to the project, incoming President Trump tweeted his disapproval, saying: \"Every penny of the $7 billion going to Africa as per Obama will be stolen — corruption is rampant!\" </> One of Mr Obama\\'s biggest commitments on the continent was to its future leaders. </> In 2010, he launched the Young African Leaders Initiative (Yali) to help youths on the continent prepare for leadership positions by providing training, networking, and skills building opportunities.  </> More than 250,000 people have since joined the network. </> At a Yali programme graduation ceremony in Nairobi, the mood is optimistic that even as Mr Obama leaves office, his legacy will live on. </> One of the graduates, Jerono Odhiambo says: \"I feel like we\\'ll be saying thanks to Obama even after he\\'s left because he provided us with this network, and now he\\'s telling us to do what he did - and we\\'re inspired by that.\"  </> Farhan Yusuf, a programme fellow from Tanzania adds: \"Yali has shown a lot of impact in terms of the stories that are being shared, and the networks that are being generated - the message here, the impact here is much bigger than any individual\". </> Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi is also a beneficiary of the US president\\'s leadership initiative.  </> He says the training he got at a US college thanks to Yali has had a tremendous impact on his business, which manufactures nutritious flours. </> \"We have raised over $100,000 purely from the support of Yali, and we\\'ve been able to grow the business close to 10 times since I joined Yali in 2014.\" </> Entrepreneurship, trade and investment were central to Mr Obama\\'s expansion of US-Africa policy beyond foreign assistance and counter-terrorism. </> However, much of the impact of his long-term initiatives will be subject to the policy orientation of the Trump administration. </> The substance of Mr Obama\\'s presidency may not have been what many in Africa had hoped for, but its symbolism remains strong.  </> In assessing his relationship with the continent as the president of the United States, the instruction he offered in Ghana in 2009 should be well considered - that \"we must start from the simple premise that Africa\\'s future is up to Africans.\"'},\n",

Many had queued in the rain for hours. </> The previous year,  George Clooney visited Social Bite in Rose Street. </> The actor visited the cafe, which donates all its profits to homeless people, leaving $1,000 (about £650) for the cause. </> He stayed at the cafe for around 15 minutes, and greeted the 200-strong crowd who were waiting outside.  </> Mr Clooney shook hands, posed for selfies and chatted with fans. </> All of the cash raised will be split between children\\'s charities in Scotland and the Obama Foundation, set up by the former president and his wife Michelle. </> Sir Tom also plans to set aside some seats at the event for local young people. </> He said: \"From the South Side of Chicago to the White House has been an epic, historic journey and it will be a true honour to hear that story from the man who made that journey. </> \"We are both truly proud and delighted to be hosting the 44th president of the United States in Scotland at this event.\" </> Sir Tom told the Press Association he is \"really chuffed\" Mr Obama is coming to Scotland. </> \"We\\'re always looking for really inspiring speakers to come along to Scotland, and really inspire and inform,\" Sir Tom said. </> \"To be able to get president Obama, we\\'re really chuffed.\" </> The entrepreneur-turned-philanthropist also revealed he is planning a special surprise for the 44th US president. </> He said: \"President Obama loves his music, so we\\'re getting some interesting guests.\" </> Speaking from New York as she continued her five-day visit to the US, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland she was \"really excited\" about the announcement. </> Ms Sturgeon added: \"Lots of people back home in Scotland will be really looking forward to welcoming President Obama and hearing what he has to say\".

Countrywide, cases have surpassed 1.5 million.  </> Ms Brzezinski then turned to Twitter, saying the company should remove Mr Trump\\'s tweets.  </> \"You should be ashamed of yourself,\" she scolded the social media giant.  </> It is by no means the president\\'s first clash with the couple. In 2017, he referred to Ms Brzezinski on Twitter as \"low IQ Crazy Mika\" and claimed she had been \"bleeding badly from a face-lift\" when he saw her once near his Florida home. </> On Wednesday, Mr Trump complained that his convicted former adviser Roger Stone had been treated unfairly, \"while guys like Low Ratings Psycho Joe Scarborough are allowed to walk the streets? Open Cold Case!\" </> Last week he tweeted: \"When will they open a Cold Case on the Psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida. Did he get away with murder? Some people think so. Why did he leave Congress so quietly and quickly? Isn\\'t it obvious? What\\'s happening now? A total nut job!\" </> The president first directed the baseless charge at Mr Scarborough in November 2017, suggesting he should be fired \"based on the \\'unsolved mystery\\' that took place in Florida years ago\". </> However, the case the president is apparently referring to is not a cold case.  </> Mr Scarborough is a former Republican congressman who represented a Florida district from 1995 to 2001. In July 2001, a member of his staff, 28-year-old Lori Klausutis, was found dead in the lawmaker\\'s office in Fort Walton Beach. </> Mr Scarborough was in Washington DC at the time. Despite the president\\'s suggestion of something untoward in his exit from Congress, Mr Scarborough had stepped down before Klausutis\\' death.  </> Authorities determined Klausutis died after losing consciousness from an abnormal heart rhythm, before collapsing and striking her head. She had told a colleague a day earlier that she felt unwell. </> Police found no foul play and a medical examiner established Klausutis had suffered an acute subdural hematoma, or blood clot, ruling her death accidental.  </> After Mr Trump\\'s tweet about the matter on 12 May, Mr Scarborough said live on air: \"Why don\\'t you turn off the television, and why don\\'t you start working, OK?\"  </> Mr Trump was the most high-profile supporter of the bogus \"birther\" theory that former President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and ineligible for the presidency. </> In 2016, Mr Trump suggested the father of his then-Republican presidential rival Ted Cruz had been seen with John F Kennedy\\'s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, before the president\\'s death. His source for the claim was an unverified tabloid report. </> Last April, Mr Trump suggested that the noise from windmills causes cancer. Scientists have found no such health risks. </> The president has also shared a baseless theory that former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton were connected to last year\\'s prison suicide of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

       "  'text': ' </> Barack Obama has warned of a \"rise in a crude sort of nationalism\" following the Brexit and US presidential votes. </> Speaking in Greece on his final foreign trip, he said: \"We have to guard against... tribalism built around an \\'us\\' or a \\'them\\'.\" </> He said the US was painfully aware of the danger of divisions \"along lines of race or religion or ethnicity\". </> He also put the victory of Donald Trump down to \"the view of the American people to just shake things up\". </> Mr Obama was speaking after talks with Greek PM Alexis Tsipras in the capital, Athens, as part of a final tour that also takes in Germany and Peru.  </> He said again that he had been surprised by Mr Trump\\'s victory. </> Mr Obama said part of the result was down to \"natural desires for change if you\\'ve had an incumbent who\\'s been there for eight years\". </> \"At times of significant stress, people are going to be looking for something and they may opt for change even if they are not entirely confident what that change will bring.\" </> He added: \"The lesson I draw is that we have to deal with issues like inequality, economic dislocation, people\\'s fears that their children will not do as well as they have.\" </> Mr Obama said the UK\\'s vote to leave the EU and the US vote showed that people generally were now \"less certain of their national identities and place in the world\" and that had produced populist movements both on the left and the right. </> He said a suspicion of globalisation and elites, wrapped up in issues of religious or ethnic or cultural identity was \"a volatile mix\". </> He said: \"Now we need to satisfy the people who are fearful, angry or concerned and that\\'s going to be a pretty big test.\" </> Mr Obama insisted his vision - where \"the future will be decided by what we have in common, rather than what leads us into conflict\" - was the right one. </> He also said he was responsible for facilitating a good transition, presenting to Mr Trump his best ideas about how to move the country forward. </> Mr Obama will be using the European leg of his trip to try to reassure leaders about future US commitment to its international alliances. </> For the first 30 minutes of their news conference, Mr Obama and Mr Tsipras managed to avoid talking about President-elect Trump. Given the drama of last week\\'s election result, that surely sets some kind of record.  </> But the two leaders soon faced questions about Mr Trump\\'s impact. Mr Obama chose his words carefully. He obeys two American traditions which come together on this trip: an outgoing president is normally gracious about his successor and a president on a foreign trip doesn\\'t criticise his opponents back home.  </> Mr Tsipras - who himself came to power as the leader of a populist movement - said he knew very little about Mr Trump and hadn\\'t read his book The Art of the Deal. The Greek PM then aligned himself with the position laid out by Mr Obama since the election result - that the United States is bound by a series of commitments to Europe and Nato that will endure.  </> But Greece will be worried. President Obama has advocated debt relief for this country. President-elect Trump may be unlikely to do the same. </> Before leaving the US, Mr Obama said President-elect Trump had \"expressed a great interest\" in maintaining the US commitment to Nato, although during the campaign the Republican had said he might abandon a guarantee of protection for fellow Nato countries. </> Article 5 of the Nato treaty commits allies to come to the aid of a member state under attack. Mr Trump\\'s statements had alarmed the Baltic states, which fear Russian aggression. </> Much of Mr Obama\\'s news conference with Mr Tsipras concerned the Greek economy. </> Greece\\'s debt jargon explained </> Greece\\'s third debt bailout </> Mr Tsipras praised Mr Obama for his support and for pursuing an economic policy in the US that focused on quantitative easing and job creation, rather than on the austerity measures favoured in Europe. </> Greece agreed a third economic bailout package with international creditors in the middle of last year. </> It was worth about €86bn ($92bn) but came with strict austerity measures. Greece says it needs  a major debt restructuring programme to ease its economic malaise. </> Mr Obama again signalled support for that, saying the Greek economy needed \"space to return to growth\" and that austerity could not be the only strategy. </> Greek anarchist and left-wing groups later held protests in Athens \"against the representative of imperialist powers\". </> Police used tear gas to disperse some 3,000 demonstrators who had tried to break through a cordon of police vehicles. </> The protesters then pulled back to the Athens Polytechnic area and threw petrol bombs at officers. </> At least four people were arrested. </> Police have banned public gatherings in central Athens and near the city\\'s international airport until after Mr Obama\\'s departure on Wednesday.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> For the Times,  MPs have been given a \"concession\"  after they were promised the chance to vote on Theresa May\\'s deal with EU negotiators six months before the UK leaves the EU. </> The paper says Number 10 was \"forced into the move to avoid defeat\" at the hands of Labour and Tory rebels. </> Before the government\\'s move to head off a rebellion, there were 20 Conservative MPs who were ready to defy Downing Street and vote against the government on Article 50 amendments, the paper says. </> According to the Guardian , however, the prime minister successfully \"faced down a Conservative rebellion over Brexit\". </> A potential Tory rebellion was \"virtually cancelled out\" by six pro-Brexit Labour MPs who voted with the government, it says. </> The government remains relatively confident the Brexit bill will pass its third and final Commons reading on Wednesday without changes, before heading to the Lords, the paper adds. </> The Daily Telegraph warns  the European Union is facing a new Greek debt crisis.  </> It claims the state of the government finances in Greece could destabilise the whole eurozone, and quotes the International Monetary Fund as saying a new bailout is needed.  </> The paper notes that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is unwilling to send funds directly to Athens as she faces a tough re-election battle in the autumn.  </> It predicts the Greek debt problems will come to the fore as soon as July, when the country is due to repay around 7bn euros to its creditors. </> The Guardian considers the government\\'s white paper on the housing market in England and concludes it does nothing to confront what it calls  the country\\'s \"housing crisis\" .   </> The paper says the government is not addressing the obsession of buyers in extending themselves to own a home.  </> It says there needs to be an honest admission that there is no chance of building the extra 250,000 new homes a year that the government says are required. </> The Daily Telegraph reflects on the news that the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinks tax rises and cuts to public services are set to continue well into the next decade.   </> In an editorial,  the paper says the British state has regressed 30 years, threatening to reverse the direction of travel Margaret Thatcher struggled so hard to establish.   </> It says that while it is admirable that the government wants to reduce the deficit, taxes have risen for seven years in a row - and another way of raising cash would be by reducing our foreign aid budget. </> The Times says  teachers are using police-style body cameras  to record misbehaving pupils.  </> The paper says at least two comprehensives in England - both with a history of unruly pupils - are using the cameras to tackle \"constant low level disruption\".  </> The Information Commissioner\\'s Office - which regulates privacy issues - said that schools were free to use the technique as a \"self-reflection\" tool for students. </> In its editorial, the Times says  that Commons Speaker John Bercow over-reached his office when he tried to pre-emptively bar US President Donald Trump from addressing Parliament.  </> The paper says that while the speaker is entitled to his personal opinions, his comments smell of hypocrisy - having already invited the presidents of China, Kuwait and Indonesia to address MPs and peers.  </> It says that while Mr Bercow has done a reasonable job as speaker, his desire for personal publicity has \"blighted his record\".  </> In his column in the Daily Mail , Quentin Letts says Mr Bercow\\'s criticism of the president is all the more surprising given the fact that he is a \"mini\" Trump himself.   </> He says Mr Bercow is as greedy for attention as the president and has the same inflated self-regard.  </> The  Guardian though says Mr Bercow did not over-reach his powers .  </> The paper says he was right to intervene because, if Britain is truly pro-American, it cannot want Mr Trump\\'s presidency to succeed.  </> It says the president\\'s temperament does not tolerate \"democratic restraint\" and he wants his whim enacted as law.  </> And finally. </> They are the photos that show former US President Barack Obama \"as you\\'ve never seen him before\",  according to the Sun . </> The photographs show Mr Obama learning to kitesurf while on holiday at Sir Richard Branson\\'s luxurious Necker Island in the Caribbean. </> The \"worries of the White House are clearly far from Obama\\'s mind\",  says the Daily Mail . </> The  Guardian says US presidents  \"don\\'t get to have very much fun\", however, \"whatever Barack Obama might be missing about the Oval Office, those restrictions don\\'t appear to be one of them\". </> \"Branson challenged the ex-president to learn how to kiteboard before Branson himself could learn to foilboard, another young watersport that resembles water skiing.  </> \"According to Branson\\'s post, it was a challenge Obama easily won,\" the paper says.'},\n",

       "  'date_published': '7 Sep 2016',\n",
       "  'text': ' </> The bombs, as one Laotian recalled, \"fell like rain\", US President Barack Obama said on a visit to Laos, a first for any sitting US president. </> \"Given our history here, I believe that the United States has a moral obligation to help Laos heal,\" he said. </> He referred to America\\'s secret and devastating bombing of Laos during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 70s. </> Some $90m (£68m) will be spent over three years for the removal of cluster bombs and other unexploded ordnance. </> That compares to $100m spent in the last 20 years. </> Mr Obama did not offer an apology for the bombing.  </> In his comments on Tuesday, President Obama described Laos as the most heavily bombed nation in history. Eight bombs a minute were dropped on average during the Vietnam war between 1964 and 1973 - more than the amount used during the whole of World War Two. </> The US flew 580,344 bombing missions over Laos, dropping 260m bombs - equating to 2m tons of ordnance, with many targets in the south and north struck time and again as part of efforts to isolate Communist North Vietnamese forces. </> Most devices dropped were anti-personnel cluster bombs. An estimated 30% of these munitions did not detonate.  </> Ten of the 18 Laotian provinces have been described as \"severely contaminated\" by unexploded ordnance (UXO). </> Mine-clearing agencies estimate that about 288m cluster munitions and about 75m unexploded bombs were left across Laos after the war ended.  </> Cluster bombs scatter explosives across a wide area and often fail to detonate on impact. </> They pose a significant threat to civilians because of both their impact at the time of use and their deadly legacy. </> Launched from the ground or dropped from the air, cluster munitions consist of containers that open and disperse sub-munitions indiscriminately over a wide area. </> Many explosive sub-munitions, also known as bomblets, fail to detonate as designed, becoming landmines that kill and maim indiscriminately. </> They are difficult to locate and remove, posing a danger to civilians long after conflicts end. </> Children are particularly at risk, as they can be attracted to the bombs\\' toy-like appearance. </> The Convention on Cluster Munitions bans the stockpiling, use and transfer of virtually all existing cluster bombs, and also provides for the clearing up of unexploded munitions. </> It has been adopted by 108 states, but not the US which, according to some estimates, spent as much on clean-up efforts in Laos between 1995 and 2013 as it spent in three days of bombing during the war. </> Laos is likely to ask for an extension to its commitment to get rid of UXO when Convention member states next meet in August 2020. </> The number of casualties from air-dropped explosive devices - mostly cluster munitions  - in Laos since 1964 is estimated by the  Landmine and Clustering Munition Monitor  to be around 50,000 people. Of these about 29,000 people were killed and 21,000 injured. The overwhelming majority were civilians.  </> Today only a handful of people are killed and injured, the figures show. </> But the threat posed by UXO stops villagers from getting to their farms and renders vast tracts of agricultural land useless until they have been cleared of munitions. </> The president\\'s announcement has been widely welcomed by aid agencies working to address the UXO problem in Laos, which include the Halo Trust, the Mines Advisory Group, Norwegian People\\'s Aid, UXO Laos and Handicap International.  </> \"Before the president\\'s announcement I feared that the UXO operation in Laos would take hundreds of years,\"  Mines Advisory Group  country director Simon Rea told the BBC from Vientiane. \"Now I am optimistic this can be reduced to decades.\" </> \"The president\\'s announcement is extremely good news for us and for poor families in rural areas who lives are still blighted by UXO. </> Likewise  Halo Trust  CEO James Cowan said the president\\'s announcement will have a profound effect on the people of Laos.  </> \"It will help them live and farm in safety on their land, as well as creating opportunities for development and infrastructure,\" he said. </> \"Explosive remnants of war have blighted their lives for far too long. It is a momentous step in Laos\\'s journey towards freedom from the deadly debris of war.\"  </> \"Today more than ever we are getting a much better grasp of the scale of the contamination,\"  Norwegian People\\'s Aid  (NPA) Senior Advocacy and Research Advisor Lucy Pinches told the BBC. </> \"We are using survey triangulation data to place contaminated land into blocks or boxes which can then be systematically cleared of cluster munition remnants.\" </> Aid agencies have also gained access to Pentagon bombing records so that they can identify which areas of land - mostly the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the south and the Lao communist party headquarters in the north - were bombed and likely to contain unexploded bombs.  </> \"More partnerships in the last couple of years among international clearance NGOs has greatly helped in pushing this process forward,\" NPA Laos Country Director Jonas Zachrisson told the BBC. </> But at the same time he cautions that \"much of the country remains unsurveyed with limited data regarding the extent, scope and nature of the problem\".  </> President Obama is the first US president to visit Laos and has adopted a noticeably conciliatory approach towards his hosts. He said that the US bombings had destroyed \"villages and entire valleys, killing countless civilians\".  </> His approach has been welcomed by Laotian President Bounnhang Vorachit as a way of enhancing mutual trust between the two countries after the devastating war. </> The president in return has promised the government will step up its efforts to locate and return US servicemen missing in the war. </> Mr Obama has made improving relations with Southeast Asian nations a foreign policy priority as Chinese influence has grown in the region.  </> Communist Laos\\' economy is heavily dependent on Chinese investment.'},\n",

       "  'date_published': '10 Jan 2017',\n",
       "  'text': ' </> Barack Obama sealed his racial legacy the moment he sealed victory in the 2008 election - a black man would occupy a White House built by slaves, a history-defying as well as history-making achievement. </> In 1961, the year of Obama\\'s birth, there existed in the American South a system of racial apartheid that separated the races from the cradle to the grave.  </> Whites-only water fountains. Whites-only schools. Whites-only graveyards.  </> In some states, his very conception - involving an African father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas - would have been a criminal offence.  </> Washington, too, remained a largely segregated city.  </> When in the 1950s, a former TV executive by the name of E Frederic Morrow became the first black White House aide not to have a job description that included turning down beds, polishing shoes or serving drinks with a deferential bow, he was prohibited from ever being alone in the same room as a white woman.  </> Back then, as Morrow recounted in his memoir, Black Man in the White House, African-Americans were routinely stereotyped as sexual predators incapable of controlling their desires.  </> Little more than half a century later, a black man ran the White House - occupying the Oval Office, sitting at the head of the conference table in the Situation Room, relaxing with his beautiful young family in the Executive Mansion - a family that has brought such grace and glamour to America\\'s sleepy capital that it is possible to speak of a Black Camelot.  </> When Jack and Jackie Kennedy lived in the White House, that would have been unthinkable, even though the civil rights movement was starting to hammer more insistently at the walls of prejudice, and seeking legal and legislative redress for a malignant national condition described as the \"American dilemma\". </> When demonstrators assembled in August 1963 to hear Martin Luther King deliver his I Have a Dream Speech at the Lincoln Memorial, few would have thought that a black man would one day take the oath of office at the other end of the National Mall.  </> Likewise, how many of the protesters bludgeoned by white policemen on Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 would have dared to imagine that, 50 years later, they would cross that same bridge hand in hand with the country\\'s first black president?  </> For veterans of the black struggle, those remarkable images of Obama marking the 50th anniversary of the Selma protest became instantly iconographic, a truly golden jubilee.  </> In legacy terms, his very presence in the White House is one of the great intangibles of his presidency. Just how many black Americans have been encouraged to surmount colour bars of their own? Just how many young African-Americans have altered the trajectory of their lives because of the example set by Obama?  </> And behaviourally, what an example it has been. Because of the lingering racism in American society, the Obamas doubtless knew they would have to reach a higher standard, and they have done so, seemingly, without breaking a sweat. In deportment and personal conduct, it is hard to recall a more impressive or well-rounded First Family.  </> The \"when they go low, we go high\" approach to racists who questioned his citizenship has made the Obamas look even more classy.  </> His family\\'s dignity in the face of such ugliness recalls the poise of black sit-in protesters in the early 60s, who refused to relinquish their seats at segregated restaurants and lunch counters even as white thugs poured sugar and ketchup over their heads, and punched, kicked and spat at them. </> Yet racial firsts, of the kind achieved by Barack Hussein Obama, can present a distorted view of history and convey a misleading sense of progress. They are, by their very nature, a singular achievement, a milestone indicative of black advance rather than a destination point.  </> Hollywood did not become colourblind the moment in 1964 that Sidney Poitier became the first black man to win best actor at the Academy Awards any more than discrimination ended in the justice system when Thurgood Marshall first donned the billowing robes of a Supreme Court jurist.  </> America\\'s racial problems have not melted away merely because Obama has spent eight years in the White House. Far from it. </> Indeed, the insurmountable problem for Obama was that he reached the mountaintop on day one of his presidency.  </> Achieving anything on the racial front that surpassed becoming the country\\'s first black president was always going to be daunting. Compounding that problem were the unrealistically high expectations surrounding his presidency.  </> His election triumph is 2008 was also misinterpreted as an act of national atonement for the original sin of slavery and the stain of segregation.  </> Yet Obama did not win the election because he was a black man. It was primarily because a country facing an economic crisis and embroiled in two unpopular wars was crying out for change. </> Doubtless there have been substantive reforms. His two black attorneys general, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, have revitalised the work of the justice department\\'s civil rights division, which was dormant during the Bush years.  </> The Affordable Healthcare Act, or Obamacare, as it was inevitably dubbed, cut the black uninsured rate by a third.  </> Partly in a bid to reverse the rate of black incarceration, he has commuted the sentences of hundreds of prisoners - 10 times the number of his five predecessors added together.  </> As well as calling for the closure of private prisons, he became the first president to visit a federal penitentiary. \"There but for the grace of God,\" said a man who had smoked pot and dabbled with cocaine in his youth.  </> Early on, he used the bully pulpit of the presidency to assail black absentee fathers, and, more latterly, spoke out against police brutality. But that record of accomplishment looks rather meagre when compared to the drama of hearing \"Hail to the Chief\" accompany the arrival of a black man on the presidential stage.  </> Race relations have arguably become more polarised and tenser since 20 January 2009. Though smaller in scale and scope, the demonstrations sparked by police shootings of unarmed black men were reminiscent of the turbulence of the 1960s. </> The toxic cloud from the tear gas unleashed in Ferguson and elsewhere cast a long and sometimes overwhelming shadow. Not since the LA riots in 1992 - the violent response to the beating of Rodney King and the later acquittal of the police officers filmed assaulting him - has the sense of black grievance and outrage been so raw.  </> Historians will surely be struck by what looks like an anomaly, that the Obama years gave rise to a movement called Black Lives Matter.  </> Public opinion surveys highlight this racial restlessness. Not long after he took office in 2009, a New York Times/CBS News poll suggested two-thirds of Americans regarded race relations as generally good. In the midst of last summer\\'s racial turbulence, that poll found there had been a complete reversal. Now 69% of Americans assessed race relations to be mostly bad.  </> An oft-heard criticism of Obama is that he has failed to bring his great rhetorical skills to bear on the American dilemma, and prioritised the LGBT community\\'s campaign for equality at the expense of the ongoing black struggle.  </> But while he was happy to cloak himself in the mantle of America\\'s first black president, he did not set out to pursue a black presidency. He did not want his years in office to be defined by his skin colour. </> As a candidate, he often left others to attach racial meaning to his candidacy, rather than doing so himself.  </> His famed race speech in the 2008 primary campaign, when his friendship with a fiery black preacher threatened to derail his candidacy, was as much about his white heritage as his black.  </> This remained true when he won election. Besides, there were pressing problems to deal with, not least rescuing the American economy in the midst of the Great Recession and extricating US forces from two long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  </> Early on in his presidency, his efforts at racial mediation also seemed ham-fisted. The \"beer summit\" at the White House, when he brought together the black Harvard academic Henry Louis Gates and the white police officer who had arrested him on the porch of his own home in an affluent suburb of Boston, all seemed rather facile.  </> A clumsy photo-opportunity rather than a teachable moment. Obama, one sensed, wanted to speak out more forcefully - initially he said the Cambridge police \"acted stupidly\" - but his political cautiousness reined him in.  </> Seemingly, he did not want to come across to the public as a black man in the White House. </> Rather in those early years, it was as if he was trying to position himself as a neutral arbiter in racial matters, though one sensed his preference was for not intervening at all.   </> As his presidency went on, however, it became more emphatically black. He spoke out more passionately and more intimately.  </> Telling reporters that his son would have looked like Trayvon Martin, the unarmed high school student shot dead in Florida by a neighbourhood watch coordinator, was a departure.  </> This new, more candid approach culminated in Charleston, South Carolina, when Obama delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, the black preacher slain, along with eight other worshippers, by a white supremacist at a bible study class at the Emanuel American Methodist Episcopal church.  </> That afternoon he spoke, as he often does in front of mainly black audiences, with a cadence that almost ventriloquised the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, and ended, electrifyingly, by singing Amazing Grace.  </> That month he seemed to be at the height of his powers.  </> The Confederate flag, a symbol for many of black subordination, was about to brought down in the grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol because the Charleston gunman Dylann Roof had brandished it so provocatively.  </> Obamacare had withstood a Supreme Court challenge. On the morning that he flew to Charleston, the Supreme Court decreed same-sex marriage would be legal in every state. Progressivism seemed to have triumphed. Obama seemed to have vanquished many of his foes. </> But that month Donald Trump had also announced his improbable bid for the White House, and the forces of conservatism were starting to rally behind an outspoken new figurehead, who sensed that nativism, xenophobia and fear of the other would be central to his electoral appeal.        </> That America\\'s first black president will be followed by the untitled leader of the Birther movement, a candidate slow to disavow support from the Ku Klux Klan and happy to receive the backing of white nationalists, Donald Trump can easily be portrayed as a personal repudiation and also proof of racial regression. </> The truth, though, is more complicated.  </> Obama is ending his presidency with some of his highest personal approval ratings, and clearly believes he would have beaten Trump in a head-to-head contest. Moreover, although Trump won decisively in the electoral college, almost three million people more voted for Hillary Clinton nationwide.  </> In judging the mood of the country, the 2016 election hardly produced a clear-cut result that lends itself to neat analysis.  </> What Trump\\'s election does look to have done, however, is end Obama\\'s hopes of being a transformative president, not least because of the proposed rollback of his signature healthcare reform.  </> Truly transformative presidents, like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, enact reforms, like social security, that become part of the nation\\'s fabric rather than being ripped apart. If Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress get their way, Obamacare will be shredded. </> Nor has he been transformative in the attitudinal sense. Indeed, Trump\\'s victory, messy though it was, can easily be viewed partly as a \"whitelash\".  </> Much of his earliest and strongest support came from so-called white nationalists, who saw in his candidacy the chance to reassert white cultural and racial dominance. Some of the loudest cheers at his rallies came in response his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim invectives. </> Trump\\'s message, from the moment he announced his candidacy to the final tweets of his insurgent campaign, was aimed primarily at white America.  </> The billionaire\\'s victory also makes it harder to view Obama as a transitional president. Eight years ago, it was tempting to cast the country\\'s first black president as the leader who would oversee a peaceable demographic shift from a still strongly Caucasian America - the last census showed that 62.6% of US citizens are white - to a more ethnically diffuse nation.  </> But the talk now is of walls, not human bridges. </> Of course, the notion that Obama would usher in a post-racial America was always fanciful, and a claim wisely he steered clear of himself. For all his cries of \"Yes we can,\" he was never that naïve. </> But the black writer Ta-Nehisi Coates makes a persuasive case that Obama has always been overly optimistic on race, in large part because he did not have a conventional black upbringing.  </> His formative years were spent in Hawaii, America\\'s most racially integrated state, and the whites he encountered, namely his mother and grandparents, were doting and loving. </> Obama was not the victim of discrimination in the same way as a black kid growing up in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, or even New York or Illinois. As a result, he may have underestimated the forces that would seek to paralyse his presidency and to impede racial advance more broadly. </> The president has said repeatedly since election night that the result proves that history is not linear but rather takes a zig-zagging course.  </> He is also fond of paraphrasing Martin Luther King\\'s famed line that the arc of history bends towards justice. However, that curvature has veered off in a wholly unexpected direction. </> Besides, even to talk of arcs of history at this moment of such national uncertainty seems inapt.  </> For as we enter the final days of the Obama presidency, the more accurate descriptor of race relations is a fault-line - the most angry fault-line in US politics and American life, and one that continues to rumble away, threatening small explosions at any time.  </> From Obama we expected seismic change of a more positive kind.  </> And although it was a presidency that began atop a mountain, it ended in something of a valley.

       "  'text': ' </> As Barack Obama\\'s time at the White House draws to an end, film-makers are turning their attention to his early life. Two biopics - Barry and Southside with You - have been made for the big screen. So why the sudden fascination with the US president\\'s younger days? </> Actors Parker Sawyers and Devon Terrell bumped into each other recently at an Emmys party in Los Angeles.  </> They had never met before, but it wasn\\'t hard for them to recognise each other. Not only were they signed up to the same talent agency - both played the role of a young Barack Obama in separate films about him this year. </> \"He was a nice guy, we had a good chat,\" recalls Sawyers when we meet in London to discuss his role in Southside with You.  </> Richard Tanne\\'s romantic drama, released in the US at the end of August, is a fictionalised account of the first date between Barack and Michelle Obama in Chicago in 1989.  </> It\\'s made almost $6.3m (£4.8m) at the box office and opens in the UK this week.  </> Over the course of a day, 28-year-old law associate Obama (Sawyers) attempts to woo reluctant attorney Michelle Robinson (Tika Sumpter).   </> They visit an art exhibition, attend a community meeting and end the day with a cinema visit to see Spike Lee\\'s Do the Right Thing. </> Sawyers, 33, almost missed out on the role because his first audition tape was a \"straight-on impersonation\" of Obama aged 50 - \"the kind of thing you\\'d see on Saturday Night Live\". </> A few months later, after some advice from Tanne to tone it down, he sent in a another audition and got the part. </> Sawyers, who grew up in Indianapolis but now lives with his family in London, only started acting five years ago and Obama is his first lead role.  </> He was first told of his resemblance to the US president by director Kathryn Bigelow while filming Zero Dark Thirty, in which he had a minor part.  </> He started doing Obama impressions on set to keep his colleagues amused. \"I always had a feeling I\\'d play him, maybe in a biopic in about 15 years, but I never imagined it would be him as a 28-year-old,\" he admits. </> Sawyers describes the young Obama as someone who \"knows himself quite well and is very comfortable in his own skin\". </> In a key scene where Obama addresses a community meeting, we witness the first flash of him as a political orator.  </> \"I rehearsed that scene like crazy,\" says Sawyers. \"My sister came up the weekend before and I bought her a spa day, so she would go away so I could practice.\"  </> The actor had no room for improvisation. \"I asked if I could switch two words and was told \\'no\\' because it was approved by lawyers and we are talking about real people.\" </> To Sawyers\\' knowledge, the Obamas haven\\'t yet seen the film, but it is in the White House entertainment library.   </> Musician John Legend, one of the film\\'s executive producers, has apparently told the president to \"check it out\".  </> So why would people want to watch a film about the Obamas\\' first date?   </> \"They are fascinating people and people can\\'t help but wonder what made the man and the woman that we see on screen today,\" says Sawyers. </> \"I guess no interviews with the president and the first lady go that deep. You can\\'t ask \\'who was your first kiss?\\' - it would be inappropriate. So now we are just guessing at how they met.\" </> Sawyers hopes to meet Obama one day. What would he say if he did?  </> \"I guess, thank you for putting yourself out there and working. I\\'m happy that he devoted his life to public service because it\\'s an honourable thing to do.\" </> And then he adds with a grin: \"I also want to see what Michelle thinks about my performance.\" </> This year\\'s other Obama film - Barry - goes even further back into the president\\'s past.  </> Set in 1981, it sees a young Barack - known to his friends as Barry - arrive as a student in New York City where his experiences help form his views on race, politics and his own identity.  </> He\\'s also seen swearing, smoking, drinking and getting a girlfriend (played by The Witch\\'s Anya Taylor-Joy). </> \"I don\\'t think it\\'s that controversial,\" says Vikram Gandhi, the film\\'s director, after its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.  </> \"It\\'s a movie that is shattering the icon. It makes sense that you see him do everything. He didn\\'t have that many vices.\" </> Barry\\'s Obama is played by Australian actor Devon Terrell in his first screen role.  </> \"It was 10 on the daunting scale,\" he admits. \"Here was someone who could be imitated, but could I be the man behind the presidential mask?\" </> Terrell assumed there would be lots of archive and videos of Obama at the age of 21 but there was nothing. \"I did all the research I possibly could to build him from the ground up.\"  </> Terrell became a font of obscure facts about Obama - such as his room smelling of Brut aftershave and that he loved peanut sauce in Indonesia.  </> The actor also found a 58-minute clip of an older Obama to which he kept going back.  </> \"I would learn passages of it,\" he says. \"There is an awkwardness and a shyness behind him, but also a charm that comes out.\" </> And what will Obama think of the film? </> \"I think he\\'ll probably be cool with it,\" says Gandhi. \"Or say \\'you\\'re an idiot\\'.  Either one is OK.\"  </> Gandhi is happy that his film co-exists with Southside with You.   </> \"That film is about the burgeoning love between Barack and Michelle and people can draw something from that,\" he says.  </> \"Ours is a more complicated web of identity struggle and race in America.  </> \"I think it\\'s cool that you can see two different stories. I wouldn\\'t have made a romantic date movie.  </> \"It just felt so different. We were so focused on this guy going through a deep journey that it didn\\'t distract us.\" </> Barry had its world premiere at this month\\'s Toronto International Film Festival. Southside with You opens in the UK on 30 September. </> Follow us on Twitter  @BBCNewsEnts , on  Instagram , or if you have a story suggestion email  entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk . '},\n",

When you speak, it should actually reflect thought-out-policy you can implement.\" </> Mrs Clinton, meanwhile, pilloried Mr Trump for having suggested US military leaders had been \"reduced to rubble\", accusing him of having \"trash-talked American generals\". </> In a rare press conference, she said on Thursday morning: \"That\\'s how he talks about distinguished men and women who\\'ve spent their lives serving our country, sacrificing for us.\" </> Mr Trump had told the forum in New York that the Russian president had \"been a leader far more than our president has been\". </> Quizzed by NBC host Matt Lauer on his previous complimentary remarks about Mr Putin, Mr Trump responded: \"He does have an 82% approval rating.\" </> \"I think when he calls me \\'brilliant\\', I\\'ll take the compliment, OK?\" said the businessman, adding that Mr Putin had \"great control over his country\". </> Mr Trump also said that, as a result of the confidential intelligence briefings he has been entitled to as an election candidate, he had been \"shocked\" at how the president, Mrs Clinton and current Secretary of State John Kerry had done \"exactly the opposite\" of what intelligence experts had told them. </> Gabriel Debenedetti writes  on the Politico website  that neither candidate did much to advance their cause, with Hillary Clinton spending \"a third of the time fending off questions about her emails\" while \"Donald Trump struggled to explain his secret plan to defeat the Islamic State.\" </> Time agreed , citing \"plenty of unilluminating blather spewed by both candidates\". It said: \"The most dispiriting thing was the grim view of the world the candidates gave Americans, with their relentless focus on fighting and terror... There was scant optimism.\" </> One focus was on the performance of NBC moderator Matt Lauer.  The New York Times  pronounced that the \"consensus afterwards was not kind\". \"Mr Lauer found himself besieged... by critics of all political stripes, who accused the anchor of unfairness, sloppiness and even sexism in his handling of the event.\" </> Lauer\\'s main miss, it seemed, was not to press Mr Trump when he said he had not supported the war in Iraq.  Vox  was among those pointing to a 2002 interview with radio host Howard Stern that contradicts this. </> Forum moderator Lauer suffers backlash </> In the forum, Mr Trump also said: \"I was totally against the war in Iraq.\" </> This appeared to contradict a statement in a 2002 interview with radio host Howard Stern and the forum\\'s moderator, Matt Lauer, came in for intense criticism after the event for not pressing Mr Trump on the statement. </> Mr Obama said in Laos: \"The most important thing for the public and the press is to just listen to what he says and follow up and ask questions to what appear to be either contradictory or uninformed or outright wacky ideas\". </> Mrs Clinton had found herself once again on the defensive during the forum over her private email server. </> The forum offered a preview of the questions they will face in their  three forthcoming presidential debates , the first at Hofstra University near New York on 26 September.'},\n",

Other times, they\\'re just blips. </> We won\\'t know which category the Republican victory in the Los Angeles area falls into until later this year, but for the moment it\\'s cause for Democratic concern. </> The party has lost one of the \"blue wave\" seats it pried from the Republicans in 2018. Back then, Democrats nearly swept all of California\\'s congressional districts, making the state the backbone of their new majority in the House of Representatives. </> If Republicans can win races like this in November - in districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016 - they have a realistic shot of taking back control of the House. </> That this victory happened in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, when the economy is crumbling and unease about the future is growing, should be another reason for liberal heartburn. </> Democrats can comfort themselves with the thought this race had unique circumstances because the Democratic incumbent resigned amidst a sex scandal. But if they thought they had the wind at their back in the current political environment, this result suggests they may be mistaken. </> Mr Garcia said he was \"ready to go to work right away\".

       "  'text': ' </> A lawyer for the family of George Floyd, whose death sparked unrest across the US, has accused a police officer of \"premeditated murder\". </> Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder, but lawyer Benjamin Crump told CBS news it was a case of first-degree murder. </> \"We think that he had intent... almost nine minutes he kept his knee in a man\\'s neck that was begging and pleading for breath,\" he said. </> Looting is reported in Philadelphia. </> Video from two Philadelphia TV stations on Sunday shows youths smashing several police cars and looting at least one store. </> Reporting on the violence in West Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Inquirer says police cars were also set ablaze.  </> Several US cities have imposed curfews. </> President Donald Trump tweeted : \"Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard\". </> The Floyd case in Minneapolis has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans.  </> It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. </> In video footage, Mr Chauvin, 44, can be seen kneeling on Mr Floyd\\'s neck for several minutes on Monday. Mr Floyd, 46,  repeatedly says that he is unable to breathe.  </> \"The fact that officer Chauvin kept his knee on his neck for almost three minutes after he was unconscious. We don\\'t understand how that was not first degree murder. We don\\'t understand how all these officers haven\\'t been arrested,\" lawyer Crump said. </> Three other officers present at the time have also since been sacked. </> For many the outrage over George Floyd\\'s death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself. </> There have been five nights of arson and looting in Minneapolis and the adjacent city of St Paul. Minnesota\\'s Governor Tim Walz said on Saturday he was deploying the full Minnesota National Guard for the first time since World War Two. </> Governor Walz said racism in his state had created the conditions for Mr Floyd\\'s death. </> The National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - said on Sunday that 5,000 of its personnel had been activated in 15 states and Washington DC. It added that \"state and local law enforcement agencies remain responsible for security\". </> In  the CBS interview , lawyer Benjamin Crump also said \"we now have the audio from the police bodycam and we hear where one officer says \\'he doesn\\'t have a pulse, maybe we should turn him on his side\\', but yet officer Chauvin says \\'no, we\\'re going to keep him in this position\\'. That\\'s intent. </> \"Also, the fact that officer Chauvin kept his knee on his neck for almost three minutes after he was unconscious.\" </> The lawyer also said Mr Chauvin and Mr Floyd already knew each other before Mr Floyd\\'s death in custody. </> He said the Floyd family was \"notified by the owner of a club that Derek Chauvin was an off-duty police officer where George Floyd was a security guard, and so they had to overlap\". </> For three years, Donald Trump presided over a nation of relative peace and prosperity. The crises he faced were largely of his own making, and he confronted them by rallying his supporters and condemning his opponents. </> Now Trump faces a situation ill-suited to a playbook of division. The US economy has been hobbled by a deadly pandemic. George Floyd\\'s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has spread racial unrest across the nation. The public is uncertain and afraid - and increasingly angry. </> These are circumstances that would test the abilities of even the most skilful leaders. This president, however, risks becoming lost at sea. His public calls for unity and healing have been undermined by a penchant for Twitter name-calling and bellicosity. Message discipline, a valuable attribute at this moment, is not his forte. </> There may be no easy way to guide the nation through its current peril. Barack Obama\\'s measured coolness did nothing to stop the fires of Ferguson any more than Richard Nixon\\'s law-and-order edicts quelled Vietnam-era unrest. </> The economic and social devastation of the pandemic has created a political landscape of dry brush ignited by the lightning strike of Floyd\\'s death. The president may not be able to contain the wildfire, even if he isn\\'t feeding the flames. </> Huge demonstrations have taken place in at least 30 cities across the US. They were largely peaceful on Saturday, but violence flared later in the day. </> Besides Minneapolis and Los Angeles, the cities under night curfew include Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Louisville, Richmond, San Francisco and Seattle.  </> One of the cities worst affected by unrest is Los Angeles. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the city and activated the National Guard. </> The entire city is under curfew. Numerous shops have been looted, including on the famous retail avenues, Melrose and Fairfax, while overhead footage showed fires burning. Earlier police fired rubber bullets and hit protesters with batons. Hundreds of arrests have been made.  </> In New York City, police arrested about 350 people overnight and dozens of police suffered light injuries. </> In Salt Lake City, a man aimed a bow and arrow at protesters and was attacked by the crowd, Reuters reported.  </> President Trump\\'s national security adviser told CNN \"I don\\'t think there\\'s systemic racism\" in the police. </> Robert O\\'Brien said \"there are some racist police, I think they\\'re the minority, I think they\\'re the few bad apples and we need to root them out\". </> On Saturday evening, President Trump said Mr Floyd\\'s death had \"filled Americans with horror, anger and grief\". </> He also denounced the actions of \"looters and anarchists\", accusing them of dishonouring the memory of Mr Floyd. What was needed, he said, was \"healing not hatred, justice not chaos\". \"I will not allow angry mobs to dominate - won\\'t happen,\" he added. </> Thousands took part in  an anti-racism protest march in central London  on Sunday, defying social distancing rules imposed because of coronavirus. They gathered in Trafalgar Square, then the crowd moved on to the US embassy.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has denied seeking to oust the state department\\'s independent watchdog in \"retaliation\" for an investigation. </> President Donald Trump fired Steve Linick, the agency\\'s inspector general, on Friday night. </> He had been investigating Mr Pompeo\\'s alleged use of government staff for personal errands, US media reported. </> It emerged on Monday he was also scrutinising a Trump administration Saudi arms deal. </> He is the fourth inspector general (IG) to be fired by Mr Trump in four weeks, and the move sparked outcry from Democrats, who claimed Mr Linick was fired for political reasons. </> Mr Pompeo confirmed that he had recommended Mr Linick\\'s removal, but said he did not know that the inspector general was investigating him.  </> \"I\\'m not briefed on it. I usually see these investigations in final draft form 24 hours, 48 hours before the IG is prepared to release them,\" he told the Washington Post on Monday. </> \"So it\\'s simply not possible for this to be an act of retaliation. End of story.\" </> The secretary of state said Mr Linick was sacked for \"undermining\" the state department, though he did not give further details. </> \"I went to the president and made clear to him that Inspector General Linick wasn\\'t performing a function in a way that we had tried to get him to, that was additive for the state department, very consistent with what the statute says he\\'s supposed to be doing,\" he said.  </> Mr Linick, a former prosecutor, was appointed by Mr Trump\\'s predecessor, Barack Obama, to oversee spending and detect mismanagement at the state department.  </> Democrats say Mr Trump is retaliating against public servants who want to hold his administration to account.  </> On Friday, Mr Trump said he no longer had the \"fullest confidence\" in Mr Linick and that he would be terminated in 30 days. </> Mr Linick was said to be investigating complaints that Mr Pompeo had improperly used tax-payer provided staff for personal tasks, such as picking up dry cleaning and walking his dog. </> Mr Trump on Monday dismissed the investigation as unimportant.  </> \"I don\\'t know anything about the investigation but you\\'re just telling me about walking a dog,\" he said. \"It\\'s terrible. It\\'s so stupid. You know how stupid that sounds to the world? Unbelievable.\" </> He added: \"I\\'d rather have him on the phone with some world leader than have him wash dishes because maybe his wife isn\\'t there or his kids aren\\'t there.\" </> Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee said over the weekend that he believed Mr Linick\\'s sacking was an act of \"retaliation\" and that he would open an investigation. </> Mr Pompeo denied the charge. </> \"It is not possible that this decision, or my recommendation rather, to the president rather, was based on any effort to retaliate for any investigation that was going on, or is currently going on,\" he told the Post. </> On Monday, Mr Engel said he suspected \"another reason for Mr Linick\\'s firing\". </> \"His office was investigating - at my request - Trump\\'s phony declaration of an emergency so he could send weapons to Saudi Arabia,\" Mr Engel said in a statement. </> \"We don\\'t have the full picture yet, but it\\'s troubling that Secretary Pompeo wanted Mr Linick pushed out before this work could be completed.\" </> Last May, Mr Trump angered both Republicans and Democrats when he declared a national emergency to sidestep a congressional review of over $7bn (£5.7bn) in arms sales to Saudi Arabia. </> The rarely used loophole in the Arms Export Control Act was invoked by Mr Trump to approve the sale to Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE - over the objection of US lawmakers. </> In a statement at the time, Mr Pompeo said \"an emergency exists which requires the immediate sale\" of the weapons \"in order to deter further the malign influence of the government of Iran throughout the Middle East region.\"  </> He said the arms shipments \"must occur as quickly as possible in order to deter further Iranian adventurism in the Gulf and throughout the Middle East.\" </> Human rights groups have found instances when US-made weapons have been used by Saudi Arabia to kill civilians in neighbouring Yemen during that country\\'s civil war. </> This is the latest in a series of dismissals of independent government watchdogs.  </> Last month, Mr Trump dismissed Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community. </> Mr Atkinson first alerted Congress to a whistleblower complaint that led to Mr Trump\\'s impeachment trial.

Many chanted: \"Not my president.\" </> Sixty-five people were arrested in New York, while shop windows were smashed and missiles hurled at riot police during demonstrations in Oakland, California. </> In Chicago, crowds  blocked the entrance to Trump Tower , chanting: \"No Trump, No KKK, No Fascists USA\", and a mass anti-Trump rally shut down the key 101 freeway in Los Angeles. </> Mr Obama and Mr Trump have a history of mutual hostility. </> Mr Trump led the charge in challenging the legitimacy of Mr Obama\\'s presidency through the \"birther\" movement, which falsely claimed the Hawaii-born commander-in-chief was actually born outside the US. </> The businessman also called Mr Obama \"the worst president in the history of the United States\".  </> For his part, the president famously skewered Mr Trump in person at the 2011 White House Correspondents\\' Association Dinner, which some have suggested may have spurred the New York billionaire to seek revenge.  </> Analysis </> By  Anthony Zurcher,  BBC  North America reporter </> Donald Trump launched himself onto the national political stage by questioning Barack Obama\\'s US citizenship and eligibility to be president.  </> Mr Obama spent the last few months of the 2016 presidential election assailing Mr Trump\\'s fitness to occupy the nation\\'s highest office.  </> Now they\\'ve met for the first time ever - as president and president-elect. Talk about awkward. </> Although both candidates played nice in their Oval Office get-together, there\\'s no denying that the two men present a clear contrast in manner and style. </> In the past, the American public has displayed a tendency to seek qualities in their next president that the current occupant of the Oval Office is perceived to lack. Contrast George W Bush\\'s board-room manner with Bill Clinton\\'s improvisational chaos or Jimmy Carter\\'s squeaky clean reputation after Richard Nixon\\'s Machiavellian manoeuvres. </> In this case, they have opted for Mr Trump\\'s blunt talk and bombast after Mr Obama\\'s detached professorial coolness.  </> Although it wasn\\'t on display this morning in the White House, Inauguration Day could provide a severe case of presidential personality whiplash. </> With the Republicans now holding a majority in both chambers of the US Congress, Mr Trump can more easily target key Obama initiatives like such as his healthcare reforms. </> Mr Trump is already setting up bilaterals ahead of his January inauguration as the nation\\'s 45th US president. </> The office of British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday that the president-elect had invited her in a phone call to visit him \"as soon as possible\". </> Ms May\\'s office said in a statement that Mr Trump had praised the trans-Atlantic \"special relationship\" while discussing his \"close and personal connections\" with the UK. </> Mr Trump has family and business ties to Scotland. </> The president-elect\\'s transition team for the 10-week period until inauguration will be led by Chris Christie, Governor of New Jersey. </> Mr Trump, who has never held elected office, has said his immediate priorities will be restoring the country\\'s infrastructure and doubling its economic growth. </> As president-elect, he is entitled to get the same daily intelligence briefing as President Obama, which includes information on covert US operations and other data gathered by America\\'s 17 intelligence agencies. </> Mr Trump\\'s team is understood to be focused on quickly filling key national security posts. </> It is not yet clear who will sit his cabinet or fill senior posts in his administration, such as chief of staff, but  several figures in his inner circle have been mentioned .'},\n",

It leverages UK power to be part of the EU.  </> \"I don\\'t think the EU moderates British influence in the world, it magnifies it.\" </> BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Obama\\'s message on trade was \"very blunt\" and \"really upped the ante\" in the referendum debate. </> Leave campaigner Mr Farage drew attention to the US president\\'s terminology, saying his use of the phrase \"back of the queue\" rather than the more common American vernacular \"back of the line\" suggested Mr Obama was doing the prime minister\\'s \"bidding\".  </> \"I think that\\'s shameful,\" he added. </> Mr Fox said Mr Obama would be leaving the White House soon, and therefore his comments were \"largely irrelevant\". </> Conservative MP Dominic Raab labelled Mr Obama a \"lame-duck American president doing an old British friend a political favour\".  </> Downing Street rejected suggestions that any lines had been fed to Mr Obama, saying the US president spoke for himself. </> Sir Andrew Cahn, a former chief executive of UK Trade & Investment, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that Britain would \"miss out on something very important and valuable\" if it left the EU and was not part of a  proposed trade deal  between the bloc and the US. </> Former foreign secretary Lord Owen said \"Britain needs to create new markets away from the EU\".  </> Meanwhile, another prominent Leave campaigner - former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith - has tried to move the referendum debate on to immigration. </> In an article  in the Daily Mail, he says the introduction of a national living wage - a move he supported while in government - will \"surely lead to another stampede to our borders\". </> He adds: \"To make the Living Wage work for British people, we need to be able to control the number of people coming in.\" </> Earlier on Saturday, Mr Obama visited the Globe Theatre, where celebrations marking the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\\'s death are taking place. </> He watched actors perform several scenes from Hamlet, later joining them on stage. </> \"That was wonderful. I didn\\'t want it to stop,\" he said. </> Later, he will hold talks with Labour leader Mr Corbyn. </> The UK\\'s EU vote: All you need to know </> EU for beginners: A guide </> Is Britain safer in or out of the EU? </> A-Z guide to EU-speak </> Who\\'s who: The Vote Leave team </> Who\\'s who: The Remain campaign'},\n",

For many economists that represents \"full employment\". </> But the chart doesn\\'t tell us WHY the job market bottomed out and started its long expansion.  </> For an explanation of that you might start with one word: Detroit </> Detroit, or rather the US car industry with which the city is synonymous, was seemingly in its death throes in January 2009.  </> The recession and financial crisis had hit General Motors, Chrysler and Ford particularly hard.  </> Already heavily indebted, by the turn of the Obama administration it looked like they would simply run out of cash and cease operations within weeks. </> President Obama\\'s decision to bail out General Motors and Chrysler with bridging loans and managed bankruptcies (Ford managed to turn itself around without government money) was deeply controversial.  </> But look again at the chart.  </> If the auto industry had in fact collapsed, we would probably need to spread something like a million more job losses across those bars for 2009-10.  </> Beyond the number of jobs directly or indirectly lost, it\\'s hard to calculate the ultimate economic effects of a disintegration of the US auto industry.  </> But it seems safe to say that America would look very different indeed without the auto bailout. </> There was also Mr Obama\\'s stimulus package - or the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, to give it its official name.  </> This was a package of government spending which Congress passed, at the new president\\'s behest, within weeks of his taking office.  </> It too met fierce criticism and its impact has long been disputed.  </> Still, more than one analysis has estimated that through 2010 it created or saved more than 2 million jobs.  </> Taking those away would also dramatically alter the non-farm payrolls chart. </> At least it would for the beginning of Mr Obama\\'s presidency.  </> But after the first two years of his administration the politics of job creation, like everything else, changed.  </> The Republican Party\\'s capture of the House of Representatives in November 2010 deprived the president of most of his influence on the writing of new laws.  </> He lost his grasp of one of the main levers of economic control and never regained it.  </> That means that so much of the long period of job growth, from 2011 to the present, has unfolded with little input from the White House. </> Of course the president always has large powers, whoever controls Congress, but they tend to be in the administration of business regulations and in trade relations.   </> Attributing the creation of jobs to those functions of government is even more speculative than attributing them to new laws. </> Still, if presidents cannot write laws, their veto power means laws can hardly ever be passed without them.  </> It is a feature of the notorious political \"gridlock\" that has characterised much of the Obama era.  </> The president and the Republican Congress have been in a perpetual stand-off over so many issues at the heart of the economy.  </> The result is that many economic problems have gone unaddressed.  </> Yet it also means that politicians, and their insistence on change and reform, have been kept on the sidelines, leaving the economy to develop without them. </> In the absence of major external shocks, perhaps the consistent job growth the US has enjoyed for more than six years should be attributed, not to the name and the politics of the president but to things more fundamental to the US and its brand of capitalism. </> It seems appropriate that after the steep steps down, then up, in the first 18 months of the non-farm payrolls bar chart, what the Obama presidency looks like is then a consistent series of bars, representing steady if undramatic job growth, month after month after month.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> Violence has erupted in cities across the US on the sixth night of protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd. </> Dozens of cities imposed curfews, but many people ignored them, leading to stand-offs and clashes. </> Riot police faced off with protesters in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and LA, firing tear gas and pepper bullets to try to disperse crowds. </> Police vehicles were set on fire and shops were looted in several cities.  </> The country is experiencing the most widespread racial turbulence and civil unrest since the backlash to the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968.  </> The outpouring of anger began last Tuesday, after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe and fell unconscious. </> More than 75 cities have seen protests, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus full of demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. Some US officials have warned of protest-connected virus outbreaks.  </> The Floyd case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. </> For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination,  not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died . </> About 16,000 troops from the National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - have been deployed to deal with the unrest across 24 states and Washington, DC, where crowds once again gathered near the White House on Sunday night. </> Demonstrators lit fire to buildings there, including a historic church known as the church of the presidents, and threw stones at riot officers. Police used tear gas in response. </> In Louisville, Kentucky, a man was shot dead in a confrontation between protesters, police and the National Guard after midnight. Shots were fired at police officers and guard troops as they moved to disperse a crowd in a car park and they \"returned fire\", leaving one man dead, Louisville Metro Police said. </> As on Friday and Saturday, demonstrations that had been peaceful during the day again descended into violence as night fell. </> Police vehicles were vandalised and set alight in several cities, while riot officers continued to respond with tear gas and flash grenades.  </> At least 4,400 people have been arrested in several days of protests, according to the Associated Press news agency, for offences including blocking motorways, looting and breaking curfew. </> On Monday, President Trump told state governors  in a videoconference that they looked \"weak\",  according to leaked audio obtained by CBS . \"You have to dominate, if you don\\'t dominate you\\'re wasting your time,\" the president reportedly said. </> A 19:00 curfew has now been imposed in Washington DC for Monday and Tuesday nights.  </> In Minneapolis, a lorry driver was arrested after reportedly breaching a road barrier before speeding towards a crowd of protesters marching along a major motorway. The driver was taken to hospital with minor injuries and later to the county jail.  </> There were no immediate reports of other casualties.  </> Minnesota\\'s Governor Tim Walz said the motive of the driver was unclear, adding: \"To not have tragedy and many deaths is simply an amazing thing.\" </> Many videos shared on social media appeared to show riot police responding disproportionately to demonstrators. In Atlanta, Georgia, two officers were sacked on Sunday for using excessive force - including using a taser on two young college students.  </> Dozens of journalists have also spoken out about being targeted by police  despite making clear they are with the media.  A BBC cameraman was charged at by a shield-carrying officer near the White House. </> There have also been protests in European cities, including London, Dublin, Berlin, Zurich and Brussels. </> For three years, Donald Trump presided over a nation of relative peace and prosperity. The crises he faced were largely of his own making, and he confronted them by rallying his supporters and condemning his opponents. </> Now Trump faces a situation ill-suited to a playbook of division. The US economy has been hobbled by a deadly pandemic. George Floyd\\'s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has spread racial unrest across the nation. The public is uncertain and afraid - and increasingly angry. </> These are circumstances that would test the abilities of even the most skilful leaders. This president, however, risks becoming lost at sea. His public calls for unity and healing have been undermined by a penchant for Twitter name-calling and bellicosity. Message discipline, a valuable attribute at this moment, is not his forte. </> There may be no easy way to guide the nation through its current peril. Barack Obama\\'s measured coolness did nothing to stop the fires of Ferguson any more than Richard Nixon\\'s law-and-order edicts quelled Vietnam-era unrest. </> The economic and social devastation of the pandemic has created a political landscape of dry brush ignited by the lightning strike of Floyd\\'s death. The president may not be able to contain the wildfire, even if he isn\\'t feeding the flames. </> Terrence Floyd, George\\'s younger brother, told ABC News  he condemned the violent protests, saying his brother stood for peace. </> \"I\\'m outraged too,\" he said. \"Sometimes I get angry... I want to go crazy. My brother wasn\\'t about that. My brother was about peace. You\\'ll hear a lot of people saying: \\'He was a gentle giant.\\' </> \"I just had to come down here to speak to people, and let people know, just channel your anger elsewhere. Don\\'t tear up your town.\" </> On the evening of 25 May, police were called to a grocery store where George Floyd had allegedly paid for cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 note. They found him in his car outside and tried to put him in a police vehicle, but Mr Floyd dropped to the ground, telling officers he was claustrophobic.  </> According to police, he physically resisted and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not clearly show what happened at that point. </> Bystander footage shows three police officers kneeling on the unarmed Mr Floyd, with officer Derek Chauvin\\'s knee on his neck. Mr Floyd can be heard saying \"please, I can\\'t breathe\" several times and \"don\\'t kill me\" but Mr Chauvin does not remove his knee despite pleas from bystanders. </> According to a preliminary autopsy, the police officer had his knee on Mr Floyd\\'s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive. </> Nearly two minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd\\'s right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead around an hour later. </> Mr Chauvin, 44, has been charged with murder. </> Do you have any information about the protests?

       "  'text': ' </> President Barack Obama has sought to assure US allies that President-elect Donald Trump will honour the country\\'s international alliances when he takes office in January.  </> Mr Obama told reporters that Mr Trump had \"expressed a great interest\" in maintaining the US commitment to Nato.  </> During the campaign, Mr Trump said he might abandon a guarantee of protection for fellow Nato countries. </> His statements alarmed the Baltic states, which fear Russian aggression.  </> Article 5 of the Nato treaty commits allies to come to the aid of a member state under attack. </> However, in July Mr Trump said the US would only come to the aid of allies if they have \"fulfilled their obligations to us\". </> The US has long been pressing its European allies to spend more on defence.  </> Mr Obama was speaking hours before his arrival in the Greek capital, Athens, on his final official overseas trip. </> He will later travel on to Germany and then to Peru. </> Security has been stepped up in Athens, where anti-US protests are planned. </> Mr Obama is expected to use his final foreign visit to calm nerves over the forthcoming administration of Mr Trump. </> The property tycoon\\'s surprise election victory has raised concern among some world leaders after a string of controversial statements he made during his campaign. </> At a White House news conference on Monday, Mr Obama said his successor had \"expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships\". </> He said this included \"strong and robust Nato\" partnerships, which he said would convey \"enormous continuity\" to the world. </> President Obama comes to Athens partly to talk about democracy in the place in which it was born. There\\'s a lot for him to consider. </> In Ancient Greece, not far from the Acropolis, populist speakers used to rouse crowds with the promise of action against the state\\'s enemies. Those speakers were known as demagogues. You have to wonder whether or not that will remind the president of the man who will succeed him. </> Modern Greece may also have some interesting lessons for the outgoing president. The recent global wave of populism had its beginnings in this country when the left-wing Syriza movement came to power in January 2015. The party\\'s leader, Alexis Tsipras, promised to tear down a corrupt system. But almost two years on, Mr Tsipras finds himself carrying out many of the policies he had campaigned against.  </> Mr Obama may have little clue as to whether or not his own successor will follow a similar path. But he can expect to spend much of his time in Athens explaining and even defending the motivations of president-elect Trump. </> Mr Obama said that in last Thursday\\'s White House meeting with his successor, he had urged Mr Trump to send \"some signals of unity... and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign\". </> Mr Obama said he \"absolutely\" had concerns about Mr Trump but urged his fellow Democrats to accept the result and \"recognise that that is how democracy works\". </> Tuesday saw Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg express confidence about the Western alliance\\'s future. </> \"President-elect Donald Trump stated during the election campaign that he is a big fan of Nato, and I am certain that he will be a president... who will live up to all the commitments of the United States in the alliance,\" he said. </> In another development, the Kremlin said on Monday that President Vladimir Putin had spoken by phone to Mr Trump and agreed to work with him towards improving US-Russia relations.  </> Mr Trump has repeatedly praised the Russian president, describing him as a stronger leader than Barack Obama.  </> Greek minister of state Nikos Pappas said there was surprise in Greece as elsewhere at the election result, but added: \"Everybody would be expecting the US government to continue to be on our side.\" </> \"The mood of Greek people for this political change is \\'wait and see\\',\" he said. </> High on the agenda in talks between Mr Obama and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Tuesday will be Greece\\'s crippling debt problems. </> The US and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have urged restructuring of the debt but face resistance from EU states, particularly Germany. </> As preparations for Mr Obama\\'s visit went ahead, Greek anarchist and left-wing groups announced they were planning protest marches \"against the representative of imperialist powers\". </> Police banned public gatherings in central Athens and near the city\\'s international airport until after Mr Obama\\'s departure. Extra officers are also being deployed. </> The last official visit to Greece of a sitting US president - by Bill Clinton in 1999 - was marked by extensive violent protests.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX has launched people to the space station. But why is a private company sending astronauts into space for Nasa? </> To understand the background to this historic launch with the Crew Dragon spacecraft, we need to go back almost 20 years to a tragic accident. </> On 1 February 2003, the space shuttle Columbia broke apart while re-entering the Earth\\'s atmosphere. All seven astronauts aboard perished in the disaster. </> The loss of Columbia and its crew was the trigger for a dramatic shift in direction for America\\'s human spaceflight programme. </> On 14 January 2004, President George W Bush announced that the space shuttle would be retired after completion of the International Space Station (ISS). In its place, America would build a new vehicle capable of returning astronauts to the Moon. </> The following year, then-Nasa chief Mike Griffin announced that the completion of the ISS would, for the first time, open up commercial opportunities for the routine transportation of cargo and astronauts to low-Earth orbit.  </> This, Griffin reasoned, was required to free up enough funds to achieve a Moon return. Nasa established a Commercial Crew & Cargo Program Office (C3PO) to oversee the effort. </> At the time, SpaceX, the company started by South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk was just a few years old. Musk had lofty ambitions about bringing down the cost of spaceflight by re-using space hardware and settling humans on Mars. </> \"SpaceX was founded to make life multi-planetary,\" says Jessica Jensen, director of Starship mission hardware and operation at SpaceX. </> But, she adds: \"We were a very small company for several years. So we had to look for opportunities - how do you go from being a small company to actually putting people into orbit. When Nasa came out with the need to fly cargo to and from the International Space Station, we jumped on that.\" </> Musk had many doubters, but SpaceX, along with Virginia-based Orbital Sciences, eventually won contracts to fulfil the first part of Nasa\\'s commercial vision. SpaceX\\'s Dragon 1 spacecraft could only carry supplies and experiments, not humans. But it was a major milestone for the company. </> In 2008, Barack Obama became president. His administration kicked off a review of the human spaceflight programme, which led to the cancellation of his predecessor\\'s plan to return to the Moon (known as Constellation).  </> However, the Obama administration favoured the continued commercialisation of space, backing the development of private crew vehicles. But it would take time and, after the space shuttle was retired, Nasa had to fill the gap by paying Russia tens of millions of dollars per seat to fly its astronauts to the ISS on the Soyuz vehicle, which launches from Baikonur in Kazakhstan. </> Congress was initially sceptical about the Commercial Crew Program and did not provide sufficient funds at first. But Charles Bolden, the former astronaut who took over from Griffin as Nasa chief under Obama, persisted and eventually secured the support he needed. </> From their initial $50m investment in the programme in 2010, the space agency whittled several competing companies down to two - SpaceX and Boeing - in 2014. </> Since then, they have been refining and testing their spacecraft designs.  </> In March 2019, SpaceX performed a triumphant launch of the Crew Dragon without astronauts. Using automated procedures, the capsule successfully approached and docked with the space station.  </> It was carrying a mannequin called Ripley - after Ellen Ripley, the protagonist in the Alien movies - decked out with sensors to measure the G forces experienced during flight, particularly the launch and return phases.  </> Despite this success, and others along the way, it hasn\\'t always been plain sailing for SpaceX. In 2016, a Falcon 9 rocket blew up on the launch pad. And in April 2019, a Crew Dragon capsule exploded during a so-called static fire test on the ground. No one was hurt in either event.  </> The spacecraft was also having problems with the parachute system designed to bring it back safely to Earth.  </> These mishaps, along with  earlier funding shortfalls for the Commercial Crew Program , had introduced delays to an original timeline that would have seen SpaceX launch crew to the ISS in October 2016.  </> Frustrated by the hold ups and the time SpaceX was spending on its Starship project to build a super heavy-lift launch vehicle, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted: </> Bridenstine sent the tweet the night before a major Starship media event where Musk was due to speak. </> The next day, Musk shot back with a dig at the agency\\'s own timelines. Asked about the tweet by CNN, Musk answered: \"Did he (Bridenstine) say Commercial Crew or SLS?\" </> The SpaceX founder was referring to Nasa\\'s Space Launch System rocket - designed to launch humans to the Moon - which has also been hit by delays and cost overruns. </> Musk\\'s company wasn\\'t alone in experiencing challenges, however. A timing anomaly prevented Boeing\\'s spacecraft - the CST-100 Starliner - from docking with the space station during an uncrewed test flight last year. </> However, a successful in-flight test of the Crew Dragon\\'s launch abort system in January 2020 helped clear the way for the historic flight from Florida\\'s Kennedy Space Center on 30 May. </> In the post-launch press conference, both Bridenstine and Musk struck more conciliatory tones, in contrast to the tensions over the Starship project. </> \"If you would have told me then (eight months prior, when he sent the tweet) that we would be right here today, I don\\'t know that I would have believed it,\" said Bridenstine. </> \"Since that day, Elon Musk and SpaceX have delivered on everything Nasa has asked them to deliver on - and at a speed that we never would have guessed.\" </> The Nasa chief also congratulated SpaceX on its safety culture. Musk replied: \"Nasa made us way better than we would otherwise have been - and of course, we couldn\\'t even have got started without Nasa.\" </> Follow Paul  on Twitter.'},\n",

State television announced that North Korea had \"successfully placed a satellite in orbit\". </> The morning after that launch, Mr Obama said: \"This is an authoritarian regime. It\\'s provocative.

       "  'abstract': 'The US entrepreneur started her business career answering the phone, and went on to lead Hewlett-Packard.',\n",
       "  'date_published': '31 May 2020',\n",
       "  'text': ' </> The BBC\\'s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Carly Fiorina, US business leader, political figure and philanthropist. </> It should give hope to any young person striving to reach the top, knowing that Carly Fiorina started her business career as a humble secretary. </> \"I spent my time greeting visitors, answering phones, typing memos,\" she says. \"But I was really committed to the job, arriving early, and leaving late.\" </> Mrs Fiorina, 65, is looking back on her 21-year-old self, who in 1976 got her first full-time job at a small property company in Palo Alto, California. </> From that modest start she went on to become the first female chief executive of a Fortune 50 company (the 50 largest firms in the US). This happened in 1999 when, aged 44, she was appointed to the top job at computer group Hewlett-Packard. </> Fortune magazine subsequently named her the most powerful woman in US business five years in a row, with the publication declaring that  \"Carly Fiorina didn\\'t just break the glass ceiling, she obliterated it\". </> However, her time at HP was not universally regarded as a success, with much criticism of her decision to merge the business with rival Compaq in 2001. And in 2005 she resigned after a disagreement with her fellow board members. </> Mrs Fiorina subsequently entered the political arena, first as an adviser to the late John McCain\\'s 2008 presidential campaign. McCain went on to lose the election to Barack Obama. </> Eight years later, she herself ran to become the Republican Party candidate for the 2016 presidential election. She dropped out after nine months, due to low polling numbers, with Donald Trump going on to win both the candidacy and, of course, the presidency. She said at the time  that she was \"horrified\" by Trump. </> Born in 1954 in Austin, Texas, her family moved around a lot, due to her father\\'s job. Her dad, Joseph Sneed, was a law professor who went on to become US deputy attorney general. Her mother was a painter. </> She got a degree in philosophy and medieval history from Stanford University in California, before gaining a Master of Business Administration from the University of Maryland. </> In 1980 she entered the technology sector when she joined US giant AT&T as a management trainee. Her rise at the company was meteoric. By 1990 she was the firm\\'s first female vice president, and by 1995 she was a senior director at AT&T spinoff Lucent Technologies.  </> It was also while at AT&T that she met her husband Frank, and they were married in 1985. </> Mrs Fiorina\\'s success at the telecoms giant caught the attention of HP, who were looking for a fresh start after missing nine quarterly profit targets in a row. She was appointed to the top job at the company in July 1999. </> \"When I arrived at HP I purposely brought no-one new in at the beginning,\" she says. \"I did that for a very explicit reason, which was to send a very clear message to the organisation that we could, and we would, figure out what the problem was, and we would fix it. </> \"[However], I was brought in by the board to transform the company. Those were the words they used.\" </> Under Mrs Fiorina\\'s leadership, costs were reduced, and eventually 30,000 jobs were removed from the combined 145,000 HP and Compaq workforce. A further 80,000 employees took pay cuts at a business which at its peak was worth $87bn (£71bn).  </> \"Of course it is incredibly difficult to have to fire people, to have to lay people off,\" she says. \"In that very difficult circumstance, the best I could do was to fully explain why. </> \"Why are we having to lay people off? Because if we don\\'t, we will go out of business like many of our peers.\" </> When the merger between HP and Compaq went ahead in 2002, it was the biggest ever in the technology sector at the time, and created the world\\'s largest seller of personal computers. </> Whether the merger was a success, however, is still hotly contested. Tech website ZDNet said in 2016  that HP and Compaq\\'s coming together was \"the worst merger ever\" . By contrast, the Huffington Post  called it \"the merger that worked\" . </> What is certain is that the HP board were unhappy with the profits and share price of the combined business, and Mrs Fiorina was asked to resign in 2005. Her severance package was reportedly worth $21m. </> \"We did, in fact, restore a great company,\" she says. \"[But] we had a dysfunctional board. It was dysfunctional when I arrived. It was dysfunctional when I left.\" </> If leading HP wasn\\'t enough of a battle, Mrs Fiorina jumped into politics for a decade from 2006. After working for John McCain, she went on to stand as the Republican candidate in the 2010 US Senate election in California, but lost out to the Democratic Party incumbent. </> Mrs Fiorina then worked for the American Conservative Union, a right-wing lobbying organisation, before running to be the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. Looking back on this campaign, she says that \"the process itself is insane\". </> She adds: \"Meaning, when you think about the process the  candidates go through, does it really help someone to be a better leader? Does it help us to decide a better leader? I don\\'t think so. </> \"It is a really crazy process that goes on for far too long. It is far too driven by a media spectacle.\" </> But with another US presidential election due to be held this autumn, what does she think of President Trump after his four years in office? She declines to comment. </> More  The Boss  features: </> While the worlds of politics and business can be tough, Mrs Fiorina\\'s biggest fight came in 2009 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and subsequently required a double mastectomy. </> She says the experience taught her a great deal. \"While I hope to never go through cancer again, it was a very important part of my journey, and for that I\\'m grateful. </> \"I learned and grew so much during this time - learned about love and friendship, grew in my faith, and valued the kindness of strangers.\" </> Technology firm boss Mihai Ivascu says that Mrs Fiorina is an \"inspirational leader\".  </> \"She does not limit herself to what she is expected to do,\" says Mr Ivascu, who runs London-based M3 Holdings, and was included on a \"Forbes 30 Under 30\" list of leading young entrepreneurs. \"And as she has said, leadership is about changing the status quo when it needs changing.\" </> In recent years Mrs Fiorina, who lives with her husband in Washington DC, has dedicated most of her time to her charity work. This includes being the chair of Good360, which helps companies give their surplus merchandise to various charities, and running Unlocking Potential, which helps the bosses of charities improve their leadership skills. </> Looking back on the start of her career, and her days as a secretary, she says: \"I was going to be the best secretary out there. I had no idea where it would lead.\"'},\n",

The Americans would never dream of it,\" he told the BBC. </> \"I think that President Obama has got a perfect right to make any intervention that he wants. Indeed I welcome the views of everybody in this debate. </> \"I just find it absolutely bizarre that we are being lectured by the Americans about giving up our sovereignty and giving up control when the Americans won\\'t even sign up to the international convention on the law of the seas, let alone the International Criminal Court.\" </> Labour MP Stephen Kinnock dismissed Mr Johnson\\'s comments as \"utter nonsense\".  </> \"The last time I checked, the United States was a member of Nato. You look at article five of Nato, it says any attack on a Nato member is an attack on all. You couldn\\'t have a greater pooling of sovereignty than that,\" he said.  </> \"The United States is a member of the WTO [World Trade Organization] and a range of other international organisations. We pool our sovereignty in order to make ourselves stronger.\" </> By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor </> Boris Johnson could hardly be more dismissive of the arguments being put forward by the prime minister, the IMF, the Bank of England, Nato and the White House. </> The mayor of London said economic concerns about leaving the EU were fundamentally wrong and he claimed the union was corrupt. </> And he said that President Obama\\'s likely warnings about departure would be nakedly hypocritical.  </> Remain campaign sources say those arguing to leave can\\'t answer basic questions about the economic risks and can\\'t attract the backing of any third parties of any stature. </> When pressed for endorsements to rival the In camp, the mayor of London stumbled. </> Yet Mr Johnson described his colleagues who want to stay in the union of being the Gerald Ratners of British politics. They believe the EU is \"crap\" - his word - but say there is no alternative. </> Maybe his plain speaking is the passion of the newly converted. </> But with Boris Johnson as one of the Leave campaign\\'s biggest voices, if they lose, it won\\'t be for fear of being bold. </> Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said: \"The real issue here is that it\\'s actually Boris Johnson who has been nakedly hypocritical on this issue because of course in January [he] was saying that he actually wanted us to stay in [the EU].  </> \"I think what Boris Johnson has done is made a calculation about him being the future leader of the Conservative Party rather than his views on whether we are stronger in Europe or out of it.\" </> Mr Johnson also reiterated his view that Mr Cameron should stay on as prime minister even if voters backed leaving. </> At a rally for the Leave campaign in Newcastle on Saturday, Mr Johnson said the referendum was \"a massive opportunity to... burst out of the shackles of Brussels\".  </> The London mayor was applauded when he spoke of the EU being \"deeply anti-democratic\" and \"sometimes borderline corrupt\" in how it allocated its budget. </> And he said Britain would \"thrive and flourish as never before\" if it left the EU and agreed its own free trade deals. </> The UK\\'s EU vote: All you need to know </> EU for beginners: A guide </> UK and the EU: Better off out or in? </> A-Z guide to EU-speak </> Who\\'s who: The Vote Leave team </> Who\\'s who: The Remain campaign </> Pro-European Conservative MP Ken Clarke has, meanwhile, predicted Mr Cameron \"wouldn\\'t last 30 seconds\" as prime minister if the public votes to leave the EU.  </> He told BBC Radio 4\\'s The Week in Westminster: \"We\\'d be plunged into a Conservative leadership crisis which is never a very edifying sight.\" </> Mr Cameron \"would be in a farcical position having campaigned for a position that\\'s been rejected.  </> \"He\\'d be a prime minister facing a Parliament in which the majority of the MPs wanted to remain in the EU.\"  </> BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said Mr Clarke was speaking a truth that many Tory MPs privately acknowledge. </> But Mr Johnson said Mr Clarke\\'s comments were \"uncommonly pessimistic\". </> He said Mr Cameron would be in a \"strong position\" to lead post-referendum negotiations and there were no previous examples of European leaders who had been forced to step down after suffering \"adverse referendum results\". </> \"Obviously David Cameron should remain in place,\" he said.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> President Barack Obama is in Cuba for a historic three-day visit to the island and talks with its communist leader. </> He is the first sitting US president to visit since the 1959 revolution, which heralded decades of hostility between the two countries. </> Mr Obama  said change would happen in Cuba and that Cuban President Raul Castro understood that. </> The two leaders met to talk about trade and held a joint news conference. </> Mr Castro denied that there are political prisoners in Cuba, telling journalists to \"give him a list\" and then they would be released \"tonight\". </> He also defended Cuba\\'s record on human rights and pointed to problems in the US. </> \"We defend human rights, in our view civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are indivisible, inter-dependent and universal,\" Mr Castro said.  </> \"Actually we find it inconceivable that a government does not defend and ensure the right to healthcare, education, social security, food provision and development.\" </> Mr Obama said the trade embargo would be fully lifted in Cuba, but he could not say exactly when.  </> \"The reason is what we did for 50 years did not serve our interests or the interests of the Cuban people,\" he said. </> Latest updates of Obama\\'s visit </> In pictures: Obama in Cuba </> Fidel followers remain nervous of thaw </> Six sticking points to better relations </> Cuba\\'s DIY economy </> How times are changing in Havana </> For a US president to touch down at Jose Marti airport in Havana and be warmly greeted by Cuban\\'s foreign minister was until recently unthinkable. </> For decades, the US and Cuba were engaged in a bitter stand-off, triggered by the overthrow of US-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista by Communist leader Fidel Castro in 1959.  </> The US broke off diplomatic relations and imposed a trade embargo.  </> But President Obama undertook two years of secret talks which led to the announcement  in December 2014 that the two countries would restore diplomatic relations.  </> Since then, there have been a series of symbolic moments, such as the first formal meeting of Presidents Obama and Castro at a regional summit in Panama and the opening of embassies in Havana and Washington DC.  </> Presidents Obama and Castro shook hands at the Palace of the Revolution in Havana ahead of their bilateral meeting on Monday. </> They seemed visibly more relaxed than at their first official meeting at a regional summit in Panama just under a year ago and smiled broadly. </> Following his arrival on Sunday, the first stop on President Obama\\'s tour had been the newly re-opened US embassy in Havana, where he told staff it was \"wonderful to be here\". </> But it was the visit to Havana\\'s old town which brought home the long way US-Cuban relations have come since the thaw was announced 15 months ago. </> While the plan to interact with Cubans in the streets was disrupted by a tropical storm, the image of the US president and his family braving the rain demonstrated to many Cubans his commitment to the new, warmer relationship. </> The two leaders\\' meeting at the Palace of the Revolution will be closely scrutinised for signs of how much practical progress has been made.  </> Ahead of the meeting, President Obama said he believed that \"change is going to happen here and I think that Raul Castro understands that\". </> He also told US broadcaster ABC that he would be announcing that Google had made a deal with the Cuban authorities to expand Cuba\\'s poor wi-fi and broadband access. </> Internet access still restricted in Cuba </> There have been a series of other agreements between the two countries since the thaw was announced, including commercial deals on telecoms and a scheduled airline service, increased co-operation on law enforcement and environmental protection. </> Many Cubans are hoping their economy will receive a further boost from further openness and reforms as well as US investment. </> Cuban officials are banking on a growth in US tourists visiting the island as restrictions on US citizens travelling there are eased further. </> On Sunday, US hotel company Starwood announced it had become the first US firm to agree a deal with the Cuban authorities since the revolution of 1959. </> The company said it would be making a \"multimillion-dollar investment\" to bring three Cuban hotels \"up to our standards\". </> While President Obama\\'s agenda was carefully discussed with Cuban officials, one thing the White House has insisted on is a meeting between the president and Cuban dissidents, whether the Cubans like it or not.  </> Among them are expected to be members of the Ladies in White, a group which campaigns for the release of political prisoners.  </> Only hours before Mr Obama touched down, dozens of their members were arrested during their weekly protest in Havana. </> The meeting between the dissidents and Mr Obama is scheduled for Tuesday. </> Another main sticking point between the two countries is the 54-year-old US trade embargo. </> While strolling through Havana\\'s old town on Sunday, one Cuban shouted: \"Down with the embargo!\"  </> The problem for Mr Obama is that it can only be lifted by the US Congress, which is controlled by Republicans who have expressed their opposition to its removal.  </> On the Cuban side, analysts say there are conflicting sentiments within the Communist Party over hosting Mr Obama. </> The Director General of the US division at the Cuban Foreign Ministry told the BBC\\'s Will Grant that \"matters of sovereignty of the Cuban people\" would remain firmly off the agenda. </> Many observers have also noted that Mr Obama is not scheduled to meet Raul Castro\\'s older brother, the leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro.  </> The elder Castro has only made one official statement about the thaw in relations, and it was hardly a ringing endorsement: \"I don\\'t trust in the United States\\' policy, nor have I exchanged a word with them\".'},\n",

To the frustration of the many journalists covering this visit, whatever the Queen makes of the president\\'s views on Britain in Europe will remain within the castle walls.  </> The president\\'s intervention in the UK\\'s forthcoming EU referendum on 23 June has been hotly debated and sparked claims of \"hypocrisy\" from those who want to leave the EU. They claim the US \"would never contemplate anything like the EU for itself\". </> In an article for the newspaper, President Obama acknowledged that ultimately the matter was for British voters to decide for themselves. </> But he also said: \"The outcome of your decision is a matter of deep interest to the United States.  </> \"The tens of thousands of Americans who rest in Europe\\'s cemeteries are a silent testament to just how intertwined our prosperity and security truly are.\" </> In response, Mr Cameron tweeted: \"The US is one of our closest allies.

The Republicans don\\'t agree and there is disquiet at his blatant meddling in UK politics\". </> The minister had suggested Ted Cruz supported Brexit, she added. </> Speaking to the paper, Mr Obama said that the US\\'s relationship with the UK had been \"forged as we spilt blood together on the battlefield\". </> He went on to say the UK had benefitted from being inside the EU in terms of jobs, trade and financial growth, and that it \"magnifies\" the UK\\'s global influence. </> \"This kind of co-operation - from intelligence sharing and counter-terrorism to forging agreements to create jobs and economic growth - will be far more effective if it extends across Europe. Now is a time for friends and allies to stick together,\" he wrote. </> Former US State Department spokesman James Rubin told BBC Breakfast the president had not offered any words of reassurance about Britain\\'s future relationship with the US if it left the EU because \"it won\\'t be OK\". </> \"We have a phrase in America: \\'Friends don\\'t let friends drive drunk,\\'\" he said, adding that it would be \"a big mistake for Britain to leave the EU and set asunder what has been a very successful relationship\". </> But Vote Leave\\'s Boris Johnson said although he was a \"big fan\" of Mr Obama, remaining in the EU is \"clearly something we have a disagreement on\". </> He said: \"America\\'s a proud democracy built on principles of liberty. It is hypocritical for us to be told by America to embroil ourselves ever more deeply in a structure which would be absolutely alien to American traditions. </> \"I think most Americans would accept that there is something rum about asking us to subordinate our democracy in this way, when America would not dream in a million years of doing likewise.\" </> Mr Johnson originally criticised Mr Obama in an article in  the Sun  but has since been  criticised for making comments about the president\\'s \"part-Kenyan\" ancestry . </> Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, who is also part of the Vote Leave campaign, echoed Mr Johnson\\'s comments, adding: \"I can imagine no circumstances under which he would lobby for the US Supreme Court to be bound by the judgements of a foreign court.\"  </> Former British army commander Richard Kemp told the BBC Mr Obama\\'s comments on security were \"diametrically opposite to the reality\" and staying in the EU would be worse for UK\\'s national security and for international security. </> Mr Obama\\'s UK stay is part of a tour taking in Germany and Saudi Arabia, which he left on Thursday after having discussions with King Salman on issues including Iran, Syria, Yemen and the fight against so-called Islamic State militants.'},\n",

       "  'date_published': '9 Jun 2020',\n",
       "  'text': ' </> Protesters across the US have taken to the streets in the wake of George Floyd\\'s death to demand an end to police brutality and what they see as systemic racism. </> In response, Democrats have proposed legislation to address inequities and reduce deaths in custody, including measures that would require police to wear body cameras, ban chokeholds and make it easier to prosecute officers. </> Here\\'s a look at some of these proposed solutions, and other potential ways to reform policing.  </> Most police departments have a \"use of force\" policy which dictates how and when officers can use force. These policies vary substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, the type of \"neck restraint\" or chokehold that Officer Derek Chauvin used on George Floyd has been banned in New York City since 1993. </> After high-profile police killings, many departments are forced to re-examine and rewrite their use of force policies by federal consent decrees. The city of Baltimore revamped its policy in 2019 as a part of its consent decree with the US Department of Justice after the death of Freddie Gray. The new version requires officers to report use of force incidents and compels them to intervene if they see another officer improperly using force.  </> After Floyd\\'s death, the Minneapolis city council forced the police department\\'s hand by banning chokeholds and making it mandatory for officers to intervene if their colleagues are using improper force. </> Advocates acknowledge that simply rewriting these policies would not effectively prevent deaths like Floyd\\'s, and that force is still disproportionately used against communities of colour.  A New York Times analysis  showed that the Minneapolis police use force against black residents seven times more often than white residents.  </> Protesters believe that cities and states spend far too much money on their police departments without sufficiently funding education, mental health, housing and other community-based social services. A growing demand is for political leaders to \"defund\" the police - that usually means reducing funding not cutting it altogether.  </> These calls have been heeded by the mayor of Los Angeles, who slashed $150m from a proposed budget increase for his city\\'s police. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio also pledged to divert money from the NYPD towards social services, though he did not cite a figure.  </> In Minneapolis, a group called the Black Visions Collective is asking the city council to pledge not to increase the police department\\'s budget, and to divert $45m of the force\\'s current budget to shore up the city\\'s coffers in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.  </> \"Now is the time to invest in a safe, liberated future for our city,\" the group wrote. \"We can\\'t afford to keep funding MPD\\'s attacks on Black lives.\" </> On Sunday, a veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council signed a pledge in front of a crowd of demonstrators promising to \"begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department\". They vowed to create a \"new, transformative model for cultivating safety\". Earlier in the week, two council members used the word \"dismantle\" to describe their plans for the department, as did Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar. </> The statement did not make it clear if the council is merely pledging to remake the department, or if they were heeding some demonstrators\\' calls to \"abolish the police,\" which would obviously be the most radical course of action. The council president said she could imagine a scenario where the department enters state receivership, and  a team of medics and health care professionals respond to 911 calls  instead of police. </> A group called MPD 150 is calling for a \"police-free future\" in Minneapolis, in which mental health professionals, social workers, religious leaders and other community-based advocates would do the work of police. </> There is some historical precedent for a wholesale dismantling of a department. In 2012, the Camden, New Jersey, police department was fully disbanded and all of its officers lost their jobs. However, it was certainly not abolition - a new, countywide police force was formed in its place, and about 100 former Camden officers applied for and regained their jobs. The move actually put more police on the streets of Camden. The new department adopted a very strict use of force policy and made it easier for the city to fire rogue officers. </> The department has reported a steep decline in homicide and use of force complaints since.  </> Since the 1990s, the military has transferred over $5bn-worth of equipment, ranging from sleeping bags to ammunition and armoured vehicles, to local police departments through a special acquisitions programme with the US Department of Defense. </> As a result, many advocates for police reform argue that police today function more like domestic soldiers, using techniques and equipment designed for battle, than community peacekeepers trying to keep people safe, and that this approach costs lives. </> President Barack Obama put limits on how police could use the programme in 2015, but most of those were overturned by the Trump administration a few years later. </> Not only have police acquired more weapons over the past two decades, but many are taught military-style tactics. This so-called \"warrior training\" often spins a narrative where police are heroes fending off danger at every turn, who must learn how to protect themselves at all costs - even if that means killing civilians. </> Critics say it teaches cops to be afraid, and to shoot first, think later. </> In 2019, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey banned cops from attending \"warrior-style\" training, even on their own time with their own money. But the local police union called the ban \"illegal\" and continued to offer the training. </> There is research to show that  militarisation leads to police violence . In 2017, a study published in Research and Politics found that the more military weapons police have, the more likely they are to use them.  </> Citizens who try to sue the police in civil court for excessive force frequently see their cases thrown out because of a legal doctrine known as \"qualified immunity\". It was designed by the Supreme Court to protect government employees from frivolous lawsuits and give police legal breathing room surrounding their split-second decisions.  </> In order for a case to move forward, the court directs that it must ask two questions: first, was excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment used? And if so, is there a \"clearly established\" prior court ruling on the behaviour that would mean the officer knew his or her conduct was illegal?  </> This second question is where advocates say courts give officers a free pass, throwing out cases if there has been no previous, precedent-setting case with an almost identical set of facts. A Reuters analysis found that  more than half of excessive force cases in the US get thrown out  on \"qualified immunity\" grounds.  </> A portion of the sweeping Justice in Policing Act introduced this week by House and Senate Democrats would eliminate qualified immunity for police. Supreme Court Justices Sonya Sotomayor and Clarence Thomas have both said they believe the doctrine needs to be revisited. There are currently eight qualified immunity cases before the country\\'s highest court.  </> Sometimes, police violence against black people is attributed to a \"bad apple\" - an angry and racist cop who overreacts in the line of duty. </> In an effort to keep them out, some forces have fired police officers who publicly admit to racist ideas. Last July,  the Philadelphia Police Department fired 13 officers  who posted racist, violent messages on social media - but only after an advocacy group brought the messages to light </> But the reality is a bit more complicated than just one bad apple ruining the bunch.  </> Police work in what social researchers call a \"closed system\" where there is little external oversight and loyalty is highly prized. If one officer crosses the line, others will back him or her up. Without a video of the incident, it often comes down to just the word of an alleged \"criminal\" and a respected police officer.  </> That\\'s why many are pushing for police to be required to wear body cameras, to record police interactions.  They were adopted in New York a few years ago after the death of Eric Garner , and Congress is proposing making them mandatory nationally.  </> But there is  little evidence that shows they reduce violence , according to a recent analysis of 70 studies looking at their efficacy. </> Campaign Zero, the non-profit behind the #8cantwait hashtag pushing for police reforms, says they have limited use. While  footage of police brutality has played a vital role in exposing the problem , most of it was filmed by citizens, not police. Body cameras can easily be turned off, and the footage is more likely to be used by prosecutors against civilians during criminal trials, than as a means of proving police brutality.  </> There is no doubt that black Americans are more likely to be killed by police and subjected to other forms of police violence. But what\\'s still unclear is exactly how many victims there are, or which departments are the worst offenders. </> In 2014, Obama signed into law the Death in Custody Reporting Act to force police departments to report every time a citizen dies in custody. The law also required the data to be turned over to the attorney general, who would have to release a report on ways to reduce deaths every two years. </> Four years later, the Department of Justice\\'s inspector general said the department  still had no mechanism to collect data from the states  and didn\\'t expect to have one until 2020. </> Meanwhile, the FBI has launched the  National Use-of-Force Data Collection  project, to track not only people killed by police but every time a police officer uses force. They began collecting this data in 2019, but local law enforcement agencies are not required to participate and the information has yet to be made public. </> In this vacuum, non-governmental organisations and journalists have had to fill in the gaps. In 2015, The Washington Post began to log every fatal shooting by an on-duty police officer in the US. Since then, they have recorded more than 5,000 people killed by police, using a mixture of news reports, social media and police reports. Their data, which is often used by policy researchers, shows that black people were almost  2.5 times more likely to be killed  than white people.  </> (Additional reporting by Jessica Lussenhop)'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> It all started with an unexpected phone call last week.  </> Two officials were on the line from the US Embassy in London and from the White House.  </> They wanted to talk about the president\\'s forthcoming visit, and they were dealing with countless options for media interviews.  </> They had decided there would be one broadcast interview during the visit, and they were \"wondering\" whether I\\'d be interested in taking it on.  </> They did not have to wonder for very long. A fraction of a second is all it took for me to summon my calmest voice and say \"certainly, of course, you bet, absolutely\" and any other number of ways of saying yes.  </> Interviewing the most powerful man in the world is not an opportunity granted to many journalists.  </> It was already clear before he arrived in the UK that the president would have some controversial things to say about Britain\\'s future in the EU.  </> What no-one had expected was the force of that intervention and the bluntness of the language:  \"back of the queue\"  is not only un-American in style (as many have pointed out) but also notably stark in tone.  </> The president spent the morning at a so-called town hall event involving hundreds of young people at a venue in Westminster.  </> He is clearly at home with this format: he was relaxed, humorous (in a cool, self-deprecating way), informed, engaging, and happy to admit that he didn\\'t have answers to some of the questions.  </> I watched some of the exchanges and then left to prepare for the interview in an adjoining room.  </> The crew had set up cameras, lights and sound the previous day and were ready to go. All we needed was the president.  </> Anyone who reckons that interviewing a serving US president is a breeze needs to pause and think.  </> The potential global audience is huge, the matters to be discussed are extremely important, and there is no room for error. There is no hiding place.  </> The stakes for the president are always sky-high, in everything he does, but it is also true that the stakes for a journalist in this position are not insignificant.  </> We were given a one-minute warning for the president\\'s arrival. Suddenly the door opened and there he was, smiling broadly, shaking hands firmly, greeting everyone warmly.  </> I had been given plenty of advice about reading the presidential body language during the interview.  </> The challenge for the interviewer is clear: to ask as many searching questions as possible within the allocated time. That time can be fixed or less fixed. It often depends on how the interview is progressing.  </> The president fielded the questions with his brand of polite firmness, even when repeatedly challenged about the meaning of \"back of the queue\", the offence and anxiety this had caused in some quarters, and the potential impact on the wider special relationship (intelligence-sharing, for example) of a British departure from the EU.  </> At another point he rejected suggestions that Europe\\'s migration crisis has been caused in part by America\\'s reluctance to take assertive action in Syria.  </> He did allow himself a smile when talking about his wife\\'s importance to his presidency (\"I am labour, she\\'s management\"), and about the experience of being driven around Windsor by the 94 year-old Duke of Edinburgh (a \"smooth ride\").  </> But this was above all a serious exchange about some of the biggest challenges of the day.  </> He thanked every member of the broadcast team before leaving the room, and chatted with a few of us about his love of Shakespeare (his favourites are Hamlet and Lear). He then left for a meeting with Labour\\'s Jeremy Corbyn.  </> And a final thought: a president in his final year who can still enthuse a big crowd of young people - of all backgrounds - is an exceptional politician.  </> Whatever your views on his politics, that judgement is very difficult to deny.'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> US President Barack Obama has given South Africa 60 days to remove barriers to US farm produce or face sanctions in a long-running row over chicken exports. </> South Africa banned US poultry imports last December after an outbreak of bird flu. </> The latest escalation would threaten South African exports to the US of oranges, nuts and wine. </> South Africa exports $250m (£165m) of farm products to the US each year. </> In a letter to Congress, Mr Obama said he was taking the step because South Africa \"continued to impose barriers to US trade\". </> In contrast, Africa\\'s second-largest economy has been able to export its meat to the United States duty-free. </> The Unites States also says South Africa has used unwarranted sanitary restrictions to keep out US pork and beef. </> South Africa says it is taking the warning seriously and is working to find a solution. </> Trade Minister Rob Davies told reporters in Cape Town that they are \"pretty close to resolving the sanitary matters that were outstanding\". </> The BBC\\'s Lerato Mbele in Johannesburg says high-value goods such as cars remain unaffected by the latest dispute. </> South Africa could still avoid the suspension, which could cost it up to $7m (£5m) in lost trade, if it meets benchmarks to eliminate barriers to US poultry, pork, and beef, said US Trade Representative Michael Froman. </> \"We do not take this decision lightly, and, in fact, have been working hard over many months - indeed years - to help South Africa avoid such action. Unfortunately, the issues persist,\" Mr Froman said in a statement. </> Eliminating barriers to US trade and investment is one of the criteria for membership of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which was renewed earlier this year and provides duty-free access to goods from sub-Saharan African countries, ranging from crude oil to clothing. </> Analysis: Matthew Davies, BBC Africa Business Report </> These are warning shots in a dispute which both sides would like to see go away.  </> However, trade disputes are never straight-forward, but tend to be convoluted games of chess and this one is no exception. There\\'s much posturing at the moment.  </> South Africa\\'s trade minister Rob Davies says: \"When someone says jump, you don\\'t say \\'How high?\\', you negotiate.\" These sorts of warning shots are negotiating tactics; an attempt to speed the process along.  </> But if the Americans are trying to force the South Africans to accept their poultry exports, they may be going about it the wrong way.  </> The South African government is adamant that the delay lies not with them, but with the independent vets looking into whether or not the imported US birds are safe.  </> Nonetheless, missing the 15 October deadline to agree new animal health rules infuriated the Americans. But is this a slippery slope to South Africa being kicked out of Agoa? That would seem very unlikely. </> What is far more likely is that a deal will be done within two months. But even in its absence, it\\'s still a long road to Agoa exit.  </> The South Africans know this and are in no mood to jeopardise the billions tied up in their car industry which gains significant advantage from exporting tariff-free into the US. The investment figures in South Africa\\'s automotive sector are not chicken feed and are unlikely to be risked in a trade spat. '},\n",

While some states have toughened their laws, others have expanded gun rights and the US Congress has taken no action.  </> So Mr Obama did what he could, and wrapped the move in language that sounded more appropriate for a ceremony announcing the passage of sweeping legislation that, in today\\'s political environment, has no chance of reaching his presidential desk.  </> And even this small move will likely be fiercely challenged in court, in Congress and at the ballot box by whichever Republican wins the nomination fight to replace him in 2017.  </> Gun violence is significantly higher in the US than in other advanced countries, killing about 30,000 people each year. </> Congress has been reluctant to pass any laws restricting gun ownership, facing pressure from gun owners and the powerful National Rifle Association. </> Mr Obama tried to pass expanded background check legislation in 2012 after the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 children and six adults dead but it failed in Congress. </> The executive actions include: </> The announcement is already shaping up to be an issue in the 2016 presidential election. </> Leading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton  tweeted : \"@POTUS is right: We can protect the second Amendment while protecting our families and communities from gun violence. And we have to.\" </> Republican candidate Senator Ted Cruz tweeted that the executive actions are unconstitutional, with a link to sign up for his campaign correspondence on a webpage that says \"Obama wants your guns\" with a photo of the president in an army jacket and hat. </> Former Florida governor Jeb Bush tweeted that he would repeal the actions and protect the Second Amendment. </> During Mr Obama\\'s speech, comedian Amy Schumer, cousin of New York Senator Chuck Schumer, was in the audience. Two women died in a shooting at a movie theatre in Louisiana during a showing of her movie Trainwreck.  </> Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman who survived a shooting, was there as well, in addition to many relatives of victims and survivors of mass shooting. </> Shares in gunmaker Smith & Wesson rose to their highest value since 1999 ahead of the president\\'s announcement. </> The number of background checks on potential buyers - a guide to future sales - has risen in the wake of mass shootings in the past. </> Why Obama is powerless  - the roadblock at Congress </> Are you mad or criminal?  - the question a gun seller asks </> Texas women and their firearms  - a photographer taught to shoot at an early age </> Do tighter gun laws work?  - a state where guns are a way of life </> Guns at home  - the question parents hate to ask before a playdate'},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> The last thing the United States probably needs right now is another Republican presidential candidate.  </> The race is already chock-a-block with conservative white middle-aged men.  </> But if pledging an entirely different vision to Barack Obama is a key credential of any serious contender, the Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott would slot quite nicely into the Republican field (notwithstanding his monarchist leanings). </> Who knows what was discussed in the intimate moments of chitchat when the two men met last November at the G20 in Brisbane?  (You\\'d have to ask the koalas.)  </> But you can\\'t imagine the leaders see eye to eye on much. </> When Obama says yes, Abbott cries no.  </> When Obama turns left, Abbott veers right. </> \"Barry\" goes for shrimp. Tony orders the prawns. </> His legacy in mind, Mr Obama has recently chalked up the legalisation of gay marriage and a serious drive to tackle climate change. </> Meanwhile, Mr Abbott is blocking attempts to introduce same-sex marriage in Australia and has said environmental concerns cannot take priority over economic ones when it comes to tackling global warming. </> The gay marriage issue in Australia is an interesting one, not least because Tony Abbott, and indeed politicians in general, are out of touch with public opinion. </> Polls show  the majority of Australians support same-sex marriage. </> And that\\'s why it\\'s a potentially dangerous issue for Mr Abbott who admits to feeling  \"a bit threatened\"  by homosexuality - even though his own sister Christine is a lesbian. </> And it\\'s not just the public Tony Abbott is out of sync with. </> Some MPs within his own Liberal Party are in favour of  legalising gay marriage . </> So if the prime minister continues to deny his parliamentary colleagues a free conscience vote on the issue, he risks alienating some within his own party. </> Of course, in both Australia and the United States much of this comes down to political number crunching rather than personal soul searching. </> It\\'s important to remember that Mr Obama didn\\'t come out firmly in favour of gay marriage  until 2012. </> Was this because his opinions on the matter had \"evolved\"? Or was it because his pollsters and spin doctors were telling him being anti-gay marriage was no longer a net vote winner in modern America? </> You could say the same in the United Kingdom where in 2015 it would seem very old hat for a leader of a mainstream political party to oppose gay marriage. </> But in Australia, Mr Abbott is perhaps calculating that the political maths do not yet persuade him to change his position. </> While the majority of Australians support gay marriage, in key marginal constituencies, crucial to electoral success, that is not necessarily the case. </> And while the opposition Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has pledged a bill to introduce gay marriage within 100 days of being elected, many MPs in marginal seats within his own party might not necessarily back him. </> Gay marriage is not an entirely left/right issue in Australia. </> If we turn to the issue of climate change, Mr Abbott and Mr Obama are also far from singing from the same hymn sheet. </> Announcing his action plan to tackle global warming this month, the US leader said climate change was the  greatest threat the world faced. </> Compare that to Tony Abbott this week as he pledged to cut carbon emissions by at least 26% by 2030, a target the Greens party called \"pathetically low.\" </> \"The last thing we want to do is protect the environment and at the same damage the economy,\"  said Mr Abbott .  </> Doesn\\'t sound quite such a committed tree-hugger as Mr Obama does he? </> Of course you could argue that Tony Abbott is just being refreshingly honest. </> After all, behind closed doors, most world leaders, and indeed most people, would probably admit they care more about a strong economy than tackling climate change. </> And that\\'s one reason why it\\'s important not to underestimate Tony Abbott. </> While his critics are quick to mock him for what they see as his gaffes or outrageous remarks, politically he seems to thrive on it. </> Going back to those US Republican candidates, you could say Tony Abbott has something of the Donald Trump about him. </> Both men trumpet their \"plain speaking\" and trash \"political correctness.\" </> Trump  currently leads  the Republican Presidential race. </> And if there were to be an election in Australia tomorrow, there\\'s a fair chance Tony could come out on top too.

       "  'text': ' </> President Obama is delivering a year-end address before heading to San Bernardino to visit families bereaved by the terror attacks. </> The speech and the trip to California are his last scheduled appearances before going to Hawaii for holiday until the new year. </> He is taking questions from reporters. Here is a sample of his answers, with some analysis from the BBC\\'s Laura Trevelyan in Washington. </> Mr Obama said it was his expectation by early next year to have reduced the prison population at the camp in Cuba to below 100.  </> He said he will present a plan to Congress to close it, keeping back the threat of using his executive powers if Congress rejects it. </> Laura Trevelyan: The president who was elected on a platform to close Guantanamo Bay because it represented a stain on American values has been constantly frustrated by Congress. Now on this issue, as on so many others including immigration and gun control, the president is considering whether to use his executive authority to circumvent lawmakers. </> Mr Obama made it clear that when the general election comes along, he will be a key part of the Democratic campaign.  </> Obama coalition voters will be an important piece for the Democratic nominee to retain. </> Laura Trevelyan: If after eight years of President Obama in office, the American people don\\'t vote for the Democrat\\'s nominee in 2016, this will be seen at least partially as a rejection of the Obama legacy and his signature policy of Obamacare. </> President Obama said he is confident the US will defeat IS, and for that to happen, the Syrian civil war needs to end. </> \"Lawless areas\" in the Middle East must be contained so extremists cannot take hold, he said. He did not indicate he would change his approach to fighting IS. </> Laura Trevelyan: President Obama knows he must reassure Americans anxious about ISIS after the Paris and San Bernardino attacks - and justify his approach of using air strikes and US special ops forces to defeat the group, rather than the carpet bombing approach advocated by some Republican candidates running to replace him in the White House. </> \"Clearly, this is not the most important event that is taking place in the White House today. There is a screening of \\'Star Wars\\' for Gold Star Families and children coming up,\" Mr Obama said at the beginning of the press conference. Gold Star Families is an organisation for those who lost family members in the Iraq War. </> Laura Trevelyan: A jokey, relaxed end to the press conference by a president who clearly feels this year under his leadership has seen America\\'s economy grow and he\\'s delivered landmark agreements on climate change and Iran\\'s nuclear programme. Quite a change from the miserable press conference two years ago when the healthcare website had crashed. '},\n",

       "  'text': ' </> A former Minneapolis police officer has been arrested and charged with murder following the death of an unarmed black man in custody. </> Derek Chauvin, who is white, was shown in footage kneeling on 46-year-old George Floyd\\'s neck on Monday. He and three other officers have been sacked. </> Days of looting and arson in the Minnesota city have boiled over into nationwide protests. </> The case has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans. </> Hennepin County Prosecutor Mike Freeman said Mr Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. </> He said he \"anticipates charges\" for the three other officers but would not offer more details. </> Mr Freeman said his office \"charged this case as quickly as evidence has been presented to us\". </> \"This is by far the fastest that we\\'ve ever charged a police officer,\" he noted. </> According to the criminal complaint, Mr Chauvin acted with \"a depraved mind, without regard for human life\".\\xa0 </> On Friday evening, the White House was placed on lockdown after a protest was held outside. \"I can\\'t breathe,\" demonstrators could be heard chanting, invoking the last words of Mr Floyd and Eric Garner, a black man who died after being held in a police chokehold in New York in 2014. </> The lockdown ended at about 20:30 EDT (00:30 GMT Saturday), with the US Secret Service reopening the building\\'s entrances and exits to staff.  </> Meanwhile, curfews have been ordered for the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, from 20:00 to 06:00 on both Friday and Saturday night.  </> On Thursday, during the third night of protests over Mr Floyd\\'s death, a police station was set alight. A number of buildings have been burned, looted and vandalised in recent days, prompting the activation of the state\\'s National Guard troops. </> In Atlanta on Friday, a police vehicle was set alight as protesters gathered near the offices of news broadcaster CNN. </> There have also been demonstrations elsewhere, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Louisville, Phoenix, Columbus and Memphis. </> Frustration was already simmering over the recent deaths of two other black Americans, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Breonna Taylor. </> The full report by the county medical examiner has not been released, but the complaint states that the post-mortem examination did not find evidence of \"traumatic asphyxia or strangulation\". </> The medical examiner noted Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and the combination of these, \"potential intoxicants in his system\" and being restrained by the officers \"likely contributed to his death\". </> The report says Mr Chauvin had his knee on Mr Floyd\\'s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive. </> Nearly two minutes before he removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd\\'s right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance and pronounced dead around an hour later. </> The Minnesota police handbook states that officers trained on how to compress a detainee\\'s neck without applying direct pressure to the airway can use a knee under its use-of-force policy. This is regarded as a non-deadly-force option. </> At the White House on Friday, President Donald Trump called the incident \"a terrible, terrible thing\" and said he had spoken with Mr Floyd\\'s family, whom he described as \"terrific people\". </> He said he had asked the justice department to expedite an investigation it announced on Friday into whether any civil rights laws were violated in Mr Floyd\\'s death. </> The president also said \"looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters\". </> Earlier, he described the rioters as \"thugs\" who were dishonouring Mr Floyd\\'s memory. </> Social media network Twitter accused Mr Trump of glorifying violence in a post that said: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" </> Mr Floyd\\'s family and their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that the arrest was \"welcome but overdue\". </> The family said they wanted a more serious, first-degree murder charge as well as the arrest of the other officers involved.  </> The statement called for the city to change its policing, saying: \"Today, George Floyd\\'s family is having to explain to his children why their father was executed by police on video.\" </> Former US President Barack Obama also weighed in, saying: \"This shouldn\\'t be \\'normal\\' in 2020 America.\" </> His statement added: \"If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better.\" </> Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said the arrest was \"a good first step toward justice\". </> Officers suspected Mr Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 (£16) note and were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic. </> According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. </> Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started, but a white officer can be seen with his knee on Mr Floyd\\'s neck, pinning him down.  </> Mr Floyd can be heard saying \"please, I can\\'t breathe\" and \"don\\'t kill me\". </> A former local nightclub owner has said Mr Chauvin and Mr Floyd both worked as bouncers at her venue in south Minneapolis up until last year, though it is unclear if they knew one another. </> By Barrett Holmes Pitner  </> In saying \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\", President Donald Trump echoed a December 1967 quote from Miami Police Chief Walter Headley. </> It was used as a threat towards African Americans in Miami and as part of his brutal \"get tough policy\" where he advocated the use of guns and dogs to stop civil rights protests. </> In August of 1968, as Richard Nixon addressed the Republican National Convention in Miami, the police there killed three protesters, injured 18, and arrested over 200 people.\\xa0\\u2028\\u2028Similar violent police attacks defined America during the 1960s, as African Americans fought for civil rights and voting rights.\\u2028\\u2028It is not a widely known phrase, but Headley\\'s sentiments have long been part of the American status quo - US law enforcement and political figures have made many statements invoking Headley and they still do today.\\u2028\\u2028It\\'s frightening to now hear Headley\\'s words emanate from the highest reaches of our government. </> Barrett is a writer and journalist based in Washington, DC </> Read more from Barrett'},\n",

Period.   </> If you just asked him, he\\'d tell you.   </> He\\'d tell you he was the double greatest; that he\\'d \"handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder into jail\".  </> But what made The Champ the greatest - what truly separated him from everyone else - is that everyone else would tell you pretty much the same thing.  </> Like everyone else on the planet, Michelle and I mourn his passing.  </> But we\\'re also grateful to God for how fortunate we are to have known him, if just for a while; for how fortunate we all are that The Greatest chose to grace our time.  </> In my private study, just off the Oval Office, I keep a pair of his gloves on display, just under that iconic photograph of him - the young champ, just 22 years old, roaring like a lion over a fallen Sonny Liston.   </> I was too young when it was taken to understand who he was - still Cassius Clay, already an Olympic Gold Medal winner, yet to set out on a spiritual journey that would lead him to his Muslim faith, exile him at the peak of his power, and set the stage for his return to greatness with a name as familiar to the downtrodden in the slums of Southeast Asia and the villages of Africa as it was to cheering crowds in Madison Square Garden.  </> \"I am America,\" he once declared. \"I am the part you won\\'t recognize. But get used to me - black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me.\"  </> That\\'s the Ali I came to know as I came of age - not just as skilled a poet on the mic as he was a fighter in the ring, but a man who fought for what was right.   </> A man who fought for us.   </> He stood with [Martin Luther] King and [Nelson] Mandela; stood up when it was hard; spoke out when others wouldn\\'t.   </> His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing.   </> It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail.   </> But Ali stood his ground.   </> And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognise today.  </> He wasn\\'t perfect, of course.   </> For all his magic in the ring, he could be careless with his words, and full of contradictions as his faith evolved.   </> But his wonderful, infectious, even innocent spirit ultimately won him more fans than foes - maybe because in him, we hoped to see something of ourselves.   </> Later, as his physical powers ebbed, he became an even more powerful force for peace and reconciliation around the world.   </> We saw a man who said he was so mean he\\'d make medicine sick reveal a soft spot, visiting children with illness and disability around the world, telling them they, too, could become the greatest.   </> We watched a hero light a torch, and fight his greatest fight of all on the world stage once again; a battle against the disease that ravaged his body, but couldn\\'t take the spark from his eyes.  </> Muhammad Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it. We are all better for it.   </> Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family, and we pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace'},\n",

It is unclear who this person is.  </> And an FDA spokesman told Reuters news agency on Friday that 60-year-old Stephen Hahn was also self-isolating. He has also tested negative, the spokesman said. </> The three men were due to address a Senate committee on Tuesday.  </> Before the news about Dr Fauci became public, committee chairman Senator Lamar Alexander said Dr Redfield and Dr Hahn would be allowed to testify by videolink. </> According to Johns Hopkins University data, the US has 1.3 million confirmed cases and has recorded 79,495 deaths - by far the highest total in the world.  </> Many states brought in lockdown measures in March to try to contain the outbreak. But now some have lifted restrictions to allow people to return to work, a move health officials fear could further spread the virus. </> Former US President  Barack Obama has sharply criticised his successor\\'s response  to the crisis. During a private phone call to former staffers, Mr Obama called the response \"an absolute chaotic disaster\". </> Last week  Mr Trump said he would refocus the White House task force  on kickstarting the US economy, a day after suggesting he would disband it.
